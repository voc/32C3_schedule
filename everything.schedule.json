Die Abgeordneten und ihre Mitarbeiter m\u00fcssen unter widrigen Bedingungen mit Unmengen an eingestuften Papierakten arbeiten und bekommen wichtige Informationen vorenthalten. Die Ged\u00e4chtnisl\u00fccken vieler Zeugen sind bemerkenswert, ebenso wie die eigenartigen Rechtsauffassungen der Spione, die zu Tage treten. Die Theorie, dass Grundrechte nicht im Weltraum gelten, ist nur ein Beispiel von vielen.\r\n\r\nDie Szenerie gleicht nicht selten absurdem Theater und doch wissen wir mittlerweile mehr als am Anfang. Der Vortrag wird einen \u00dcberblick \u00fcber das geben, was wir seit Beginn des Ausschusses erfahren haben und einen Ausblick auf das bieten, was uns noch erwartet. Nicht zuletzt soll \u00fcberlegt werden, welche Schlussfolgerungen wir aus den Erkenntnissen ziehen und was sie uns \u00fcber die Unm\u00f6glichkeit der Geheimdienstkontrolle offenbart haben.",

Daniel will show how engineering a Electronic Control Unit (ECU) works, and how many people are involved.\r\nAnd he will take a look at the revealing communication from the affected parties. That try to share nothing with many words but still reveal a few interesting details.\r\nFelix takes the other approach and looks at body of evidence that 8+ million people have access to but too few took a closer look.\r\nHe will share the tricks to extract the firmware from the affected engine control units and share the findings he made along the way and when he looked at the plain and honest truth in code.",

                                "description": "The GFW's reactive probing system scans egress network traffic for circumvention protocol signatures, and then launches short-lived probes to verify if the suspected server is, in fact, speaking the circumvention protocol. If that is the case, the GFW adds the IP address and port of the server to a country-wide blacklist, preventing people in China from connecting to it. We recently finished a multi-month research project in which we looked at the system from different angles to answer several open questions. In particular, we will talk about:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>How the reactive probing system makes use of thousands of unique IP addresses to launch its probes.</li>\r\n<li>We discuss our hypotheses on the physical design of the reactive probing system. Our evidence shows that all these IP addresses are either hijacked, or that the GFW operates a large, geographically distributed network of proxies.</li>\r\n<li>We show patterns in the IP, TCP, and TLS headers that suggest that the thousands of reactive probing IP addresses we harvested are controlled by few centralized systems.</li>\r\n<li>How the system seems to flush its blacklist regularly, providing a short window for circumvention.</li>\r\n<li>The effectiveness of the system, i.e., how good is it at blocking servers and how well does it scale?</li>\r\n<li>How the GFW seems to treat science and education networks different from consumer networks.</li>\r\n<li>Ways to troll the Great Firewall of China.</li>\r\n</ul>",

The term \u201cpeer production\u201d has been used for years to describe a new kind of collaborative project-\u2014one that is facilitated by the Internet and in which people self-organize to create things they value, whether that\u2019s software, encyclopedias, news, maps, or just about anything else. But research about these projects and how they work generally doesn't take into account the value of anonymous participation.\r\n\r\n Moderating user-generated or peer-produced content has challenges and many services (Yelp, Google, Wikipedia, Cloudflare, etc) have turned to third party blacklists, real-name policies, and banning users of anonymity networks like Tor to handle real and perceived abuse issues.\r\nThe result of such decisions in aggregate means that the Internet offers uneven opportunities for participation and engagement.  It\u2019s easy to imagine anonymous participants as only jerks and trolls, but much harder to quantify the contributions that don\u2019t happen when anonymity is banned or made more difficult.\r\n\r\nWe interviewed Tor users about their participation in peer production projects and Wikipedia editors about their privacy concerns. In this talk, we will share stories about the contributions of anonymous participants and the chilling effects of limiting anonymity ---topics not edited and people silenced.",

Wann ist es Mutwilligkeit, wann Ignoranz, wann Dummheit?\r\n\r\nVersteckte Zug\u00e4nge zu Sicherheitschips, auch als \u201eBackdoors\u201c bekannt, stellen eine erhebliche Bedrohung f\u00fcr die Sicherheit pers\u00f6nlicher Daten in vielen heutigen Anwendungen dar. Die Referenten zeigen detailliert, auf welchem Wege \u201eInstitutionen\u201c versuchen k\u00f6nnen, sich versteckten Zugang zu Sicherheits-Hardware zu verschaffen. Die Beispiele reichen von der einfachen Firmware-\u00c4nderung \u00fcber Schaltungsmodifikationen in Herstellungsmasken, bis hin zu Sondertechnologien, deren Nutzung als \u201eBackdoors\u201c auch in der Zertifizierung nahezu undetektierbar ist. \r\n\r\nGleichzeitig wird gezeigt, auf welchen Wegen jeder Beteiligte in Entwicklung, Produktion und Anwendung helfen kann, \u201eBackdoors\u201c schon im Ansatz zu verhindern. Besonderes Augenmerk liegt auf der Erkennung bestimmter als vermeintliche \u201eSicherheitsfeatures\u201c angepriesener Technologien, die jedoch ihren Einsatz als Hardware-Trojaner stark beg\u00fcnstigen und somit geradezu herausfordern. \r\n\r\nAuch der moralisch-ethische Aspekt soll beleuchtet werden: Wer bzw. was kann Hersteller dazu bringen, den Einsatz von \u201eBackdoors\u201c zu akzeptieren, zu billigen, zu unterst\u00fctzen oder sogar selbst zu initiieren? Wann ist es Mutwilligkeit, wann Ignoranz, wann Dummheit? \r\n\r\nDer Vortrag zeigt, was man gegen diese Bedrohung schon pr\u00e4ventiv auf jeder Ebene unternehmen kann und wie sich die Abwesenheit von \u201eBackdoors\u201c wirksam kontrollieren l\u00e4\u00dft. \r\n\r\nDie Autoren blicken auf \u00fcber 25 Jahre private und fast 20 Jahre berufliche Erfahrung im Bereich Chipkarten-Angriffsmethoden zur\u00fcck.

As human rights defenders, it is part of our job to detect failures in the EU\u2019s digital policy-making. But we rarely have the opportunity to explore the underlying reasons and to debug Europe\u2019s kernel package.", 
                                "description": "In this talk, we want to analyse the EU\u2019s biggest fails and explore the following questions: Where and why is the European Union failing? Can the EU learn from its failures? Where and what is the European digital rights movement? How do we make our advocacy more successful?\r\n\r\nIn recent months, these fails have received a great deal of attention in the press \u2013 Oettinger\u2019s Taliban attacks, Schroedinger\u2019s net neutrality, the cybercybercyber war and the repeated repackaging of ACTA. \r\n\r\nIt is reasonable to say that in a complex system like the European Union, system failure is a perpetual risk. However, for the defence of human rights and, indeed, many other policy issues, limiting those risks is absolutely essential. This is why we want to explore how we can gain insights and use valuable information from recent fails to fix the EU\u2019s vulnerabilities. Most importantly, if we wish to prevent the more serious failures in the future, we need to examine how and where our advocacy fails.\r\n\r\nAccess and European Digital Rights fight for digital rights at the EU level. Although we\u2019re detecting and fighting a large number of failures that the European Union produces with regard to digital policy-making, we\u2019re still very far from preventing the big fails. \r\n\r\nFor instance, instead of proposing real solutions to the migration crisis, the EU\u2019s shortsighted vision focuses on border surveillance. Instead of an urgently needed reform of Europe\u2019s privacy rules, its governments water down the protections for their citizens. Instead of safeguarding the open and neutral internet, the EU paves the way for discrimination by the big telcos. Instead of proposing evidence-based policies, the EU is trying to justify its proposals with evidence-making surveys. \r\n\r\nCertainly, Brussels is obscure, opaque, complicated and far away \u2013 but the decisions made there affect us all. Unfortunately, among the many reasons for a failing defense of human rights at EU-level is the political indifference and resignation in our community\u2122, a lack of understanding of the Brussels maze, a lack of awareness of the extent to which our national governments are directly involved in the policy-making process and a lack of communication about what happens in Brussels. During our talk, we therefore want to explore the following questions: Where and why is the European Union failing? Can the EU learn from its failures? Where and what is the European digital rights movement? How do we make our advocacy more successful?",

Im Vortrag geben wir eine \u00dcbersicht \u00fcber die beiden Gesetze und sprechen dar\u00fcber, welche Auswirkungen sie unserer Meinung nach haben werden und was wir dagegen unternehmen und bereits unternommen haben.\r\n\r\nEinige der am st\u00e4rksten kritisierten Punkte der Gesetze sind:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Dem Nachrichtendienst wird der Einsatz von Staatstrojanern gestattet,</li>\r\n<li>Dem Nachrichtendienst wird exzessiver Zugriff auf den Internetverkehr in der Schweiz gestattet (Kabelaufkl\u00e4rung),</li>\r\n<li>Die Vorratsdatenspeicherung in der Schweiz wird weiter ausgebaut.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nWir geh\u00f6ren zum CCC-CH und zur Digitalen Gesellschaft (Schweiz). In der Schweiz haben die Stimmberechtigten die M\u00f6glichkeit, das Referendum zu ergreifen. Gelingt es, innerhalb von einhundert Tagen nach in Kraft treten der Referendumsfrist 50'000 Unterschriften zu sammeln, so kommt der Gesetzesentwurf vor das Stimmvolk, welches das letzte Wort hat. Doch 50'000 Unterschriften wollen erst mal gesammelt werden\u2026 Leider werden die Gesetze zeitlich versetzt verabschiedet, so dass die Referendumsfristen nicht, wie urspr\u00fcnglich erhofft, zusammenfallen. Es ist durchaus denkbar, dass es sich dabei um ein politisches Man\u00f6ver handelt, da das B\u00dcPF doch deutlich mehr Gegner hat als das NDG.\r\n\r\nIm Falle des NDG hat die Digitale Gesellschaft, zusammen mit der Piratenpartei Schweiz, grundrechte.ch und dem CCC-CH, unter <a href=\"https://www.nachrichtendienstgesetz.ch/\">nachrichtendienstgesetz.ch</a> eine Plattform erstellt, um die Unterschriftensammlung zu koordinieren. Zum Zeitpunkt des 32C3 wird die Referendumsfrist wohl schon beinahe vorbei sein. Wir berichten, wie das Unterschriftensammeln verlaufen ist, was das jetzt zur Folge hat und was wir daraus lernen k\u00f6nnen \u2013 auch in Hinsicht auf das B\u00dcPF, dessen Referendumsfrist wohl kurz nach dem 32c3 beginnen wird. Gl\u00fccklicherweise hat das B\u00dcPF deutlich mehr Gegner als das NDG, weshalb sich die Initianten von <a href=\"http://stopbuepf.ch/\">stopbuepf.ch</a> gute Chancen erhoffen.\r\n\r\nIm Anschluss an den Talk gibt es eine ausgedehnte Diskussions- und Fragesession zu den behandelten Themen im Raum A.2: <a href=\"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2015/wiki/Session:Diskussion_zur_Netzpolitik_Schweiz\">Siehe hier</a>",

That is until we noticed that little grey box sitting there underneath a monitor, next to yesterday\u2019s dirty coffee cup. The little grey box that is most commonly known as \u201aKVM\u2018.\r\nThe talk will tell the tale of our long journey to transform an innocent KVM into a raging key-logging monster. \r\nWe will safely guide you through the embedded wastelands, past unknown IC\u2019s, to explore uncharted serial protocols and unravel monstrous obfuscation techniques.\r\nWalking along the misty firmware woods of 8051 assembly we will challenge ambiguous functions, and confront undebuggable environments.\r\n\r\nFinally, we will present a live demo of our POC code and show you that air-gapped networks might not be as segregated as you imagined.\r\nYou will witness that malware code could actually reside outside your computer, persisting through reboots, wipes, formats, and even hardware replacements. \r\nYou might laugh, you might cry, but one thing is certain \u2013 you will never look at your KVM the same as before\r\n\r\nOur presentation will guide the audience trough an entire research project process: from the choice of a research subject, the learning stage, trough the many failures along the way, and until a complete success is finally achieved.\r\nOur research process provides useful insights for both entry-level and experienced researchers in the hardware hacking area.\r\n\r\nThis research sheds light on a brand new field that has yet to be uncovered by the security community. We believe that CCC, as one of the world\u2019s largest security convention, will provide the most suitable stage to share our research story and its implications.\r\nAnd finally, this talk is the product of a long research project which was both fulfilling and exciting, we are confident the audience will relive our experiences throughout the presentation.",

Illustrating with images I have found during my research, I would like to address the question why this material is still relevant \u2013 even 25 years after the fall of the Iron Curtain.",

Novel defense mechanisms like Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) and Code-Pointer Integrity (CPI) promise to stop control-flow hijack attacks. We show that, while they make attacks harder, attacks often remain possible. Introducing novel attack mechanisms, like Control-Flow Bending (CFB), we discuss limitations of the current approaches. CFB is a generalization of data-only attacks that allows an attacker to execute code even if a defense mechanism significantly constrains execution.", 
                                "description": "Memory corruption plagues systems not just since Aleph1's article on stack smashing but since the dawn of computing. With the rise of defense techniques like stack cookies, ASLR, and DEP, attacks have grown more sophisticated but control-flow hijack attacks are still prevalent. Attackers can still launch code reuse attacks, often using some form of information disclosure. Stronger defense mechanisms have been proposed but none have seen wide deployment so far due to the time it takes to deploy a security mechanism, incompatibility with specific features, and most severely due to performance overhead.\r\n\r\nControl-Flow Integrity (CFI) and Code-Pointer Integrity (CPI) are two of the hottest upcoming defense mechanisms. After quickly introducing them, we will discuss differences and advantages/disadvantages of both approaches, especially the security benefits they give under novel memory corruption attacks. CFI guarantees that the dynamic control flow follows the statically determined control-flow of the compiled program but an attacker may reuse any of the statically valid transitions at any control flow transfer. CPI on the other hand is a dynamic property that enforces memory safety guarantees like bounds checks for code pointers by separating code pointers from regular data. Data-only attacks are possible both for CFI and CPI.\r\n\r\nCounterfeit Object-Oriented Programming (COOP) and Control-Flow Bending (CFB) are two novel attack mechanisms. COOP reuses complete functions as gadgets, mitigating several defense mechanisms and CFB bends the control flow along valid but unintended paths in the control flow graph of a program. We will discuss COOP and CFB attacks, focusing on mitigating strong novel defense mechanisms.",

                                "description": "Bringing an experiment into space aboard a sounding rocket or into the higher atmosphere aboard a balloon is not as hard as one might think. Students from Europe can simply write a proposal and apply for the REXUS/BEXUS programme, which is realised by an agreement between the German and Swedish space agencies, DLR (German: Deutsches Zentrum f\u00fcr Luft- und Raumfahrt) and SNSB (Swedish National Space Board, Swedish: Rymdstyrelsen). The Swedish share is furthermore accessible to teams from other European countries through ESA.\r\n\r\nFor REXUS, two sounding rockets are launched from northern Sweden every year, each one capable of carrying up to 5 experiments (max. experiment payload mass approx. 40kg) to an altitude of 80-90km. The experiments have to be engineered to withstand at least 20g of acceleration during ascent and descent, and experience milli-gravity when close to the apogee. In addition, the space specific thermal and vacuum environment need to be considered. Since the altitude is too low for reaching an orbit, the rocket motor and payload falls back to ground and is recovered by helicopters. The experiments are then returned to the student teams and the data from the 10min flight can be analysed, for instance, atmospheric measurements or technology demonstrators.\r\n\r\nSimilarly for BEXUS, two balloons per year are launched from the same location in Sweden and allow for carrying up to 12 experiments (max. 100kg). The balloon lifts the gondola with inside experiments to an altitude between 25-30km. After some hours of floating, the balloon is separated and the gondola descents on a parachute. The payload is then recovered by a helicopter and returned to the launch site by truck.\r\n\r\nDuring the talk we will present two experiments which we were involved in:\r\n- Fiber Optical Vibration Sensing Experiment launched on RX15 in May 2014, and\r\n- Advanced Receiver Concepts for ADS-B Experiment launched on BX18 in October 2014\r\nBeside this, we will explain, how other interested students can participate in the next REXUS/BEXUS cycle.\r\n",

F\u00fcr die S7-300/400 existieren bereits OpenSource-L\u00f6sungen die das Siemens Protokoll unterst\u00fctzen. Mit der Einf\u00fchrung der neuen Produktreihe S7-1200 wurde das alte Protokoll von Siemens abgel\u00f6st und durch ein neues Protokoll ersetzt. Zu diesem neuen Protokoll steht weder eine offizielle Dokumentation zur Verf\u00fcgung noch existieren ver\u00f6ffentlichte Untersuchungen. Wir haben dieses Protokoll basierend auf der S7-1200v3 analysiert und k\u00f6nnen beliebig Benutzerprogramme mit diesem Protokoll auf einer PLC installieren bzw. auslesen.\r\n\r\nHierauf aufbauend haben wir einen PLC-Wurm entwickelt, der selbstst\u00e4ndig ein beliebiges Netzwerk nach S7-1200v3 Ger\u00e4ten durchsucht und diese bef\u00e4llt wenn die Schutzmechanismen ausgeschaltet sind. Der Wurm ist ausschlie\u00dflich in der Programmiersprache SCL programmiert und ben\u00f6tigt keine weitere externe Unterst\u00fctzung. F\u00fcr die Fernsteuerung der infizierten PLCs haben wir einen Command&Control Server implementiert. Infizierte Ger\u00e4te k\u00f6nnen sich automatisch mit diesem Server verbinden. \u00dcber diese Schnittstelle k\u00f6nnen wir aus der Ferne beliebige Steuerausg\u00e4nge ver\u00e4ndern.

Schlie\u00dflich kann \u00fcber den Steuerungsserver auch der Defect-Modus ausgel\u00f6st werden. Hierdurch stellt die PLC ihre Arbeit ein. In diesem Modus ist ein Kaltstart der PLC erforderlich. Dies werden wir im Rahmen des Vortrags vorf\u00fchren.\r\n\r\nDiese Arbeit zeigt, wie wichtig es ist, dass Inbetriebnehmer die vorhandenen PLC Sicherungsmechanismen verwenden. Au\u00dferdem sollten die neusten PLC Softwareversionen und Funktionalit\u00e4ten genutzt werden.",

There is also a server version available. We will start the presentation by giving a general overview and presenting findings that already hit the net during the last year, like research on Red Star\u2019s custom browser and its configuration.\r\n\r\nThe focus of the presentation is to explain in depth how the architecture of the components is made up and to give a detailed overview of the privacy invading custom code implemented into the OS.\r\n\r\nThe system is designed to defend and protect itself from changes made from user space. We will analyze the interaction of the components and the protection mechanisms and provide information on how to deactivate some of the malicious functionality of Red Star OS. \r\nNorth Korea abuses the principals of free software to provide an operating system that suppresses free speech. Therefore we think it is necessary to disclose this information to the public and present the audience on how to get around the limitations introduced by North Korea.\r\n\r\nInvestigating functionality that can be used to invade the privacy of users was our primary goal. We found that the features implemented in Red Star OS are the wet dream of a surveillance state dictator. It provides a set of surveillance features like the capabilities to watermark different types of files that can be used to track the distribution of documents and multi-media files. We will have an in depth look on how some of these features built the foundation for a suppressive state in a modern world.",

                                "description": "In the catalog of History the institution of public library is listed in the category of phenomena of which we humans are most proud. Along with free public education, public healthcare, the scientific method, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Wikipedia, free software\u2026 It\u2019s one of those almost invisible infrastructures that we start to notice only once they go extinct. A place where all people can get access to all knowledge that can be collected seemed for a long time a dream beyond reach \u2013 until the egalitarian impetus of social revolutions, the Enlightment idea of universality of knowledge, and the expcetional suspension of the comercial barriers of copyright made it possible.\r\n\r\nThe Internet has, as in many other situations, completely changed our expectations and imagination about what is possible. The dream of a catalogue of the world \u2013 a universal access to all available knowledge for every member of society \u2013 became realizable. A question merely of the meeting of curves on a graph: the point at which the line of global distribution of personal computers meets that of the critical mass of people with access to the Internet. Today nobody lacks the imagination necessary to see public libraries as part of a global infrastructure of universal access to knowledge for literally every member of society. However, the emergence and development of the Internet is taking place precisely at the point at which an institutional crisis \u2014 one with traumatic and inconceivable consequences \u2014 has also begun.\r\n\r\nThe reactionary forces of the \u00bbold regime\u00ab are staging a \u00bbThermidor\u00ab to suppress the public libraries from pursuing their mission. Today public libraries cannot acquire, cannot even buy digital books from the world\u2019s largest publishers. The small amount of e-books that they were able to acquire they must destroy after only twenty-six lendings. Libraries and the principle of universal access to all existing knowledge that they embody are losing, in every possible way, the battle with a market dominated by new players such as Amazon.com, Google, and Apple.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, Canada\u2019s Conservative Party\u2013led government cut financial support for Libraries and Archives Canada (LAC) by Can$9.6 million, which resulted in the loss of 400 archivist and librarian jobs, the shutting down of some of LAC\u2019s Internet pages, and the cancellation of the further purchase of new books. In only three years, from 2010 to 2012, some 10 percent of public libraries were closed in Great Britain. The phenomena of which we people are most proud are being undercut and can easily go extinct.",

Invented as a standard for university student satellite projects, the advantages of the CubeSat standard made it outgrow the educational field. The (relatively) low entrance hurdle in terms of cost and regulations has inspired many to pursue their own satellite project. But why do about 50% of all first-time CubeSats fail early? This talk is aiming at spreading the knowledge of how to tackle the task of conducting a CubeSat mission. What are the special requirements for CubeSats? How is the space environment different from what we came to expect for earth-based projects? What kind of components are available? What (FOSS) tools are available for the design and verification process? ",

The talk looks at the technologies of this fascinating technique and will also cover the question how to become a laser-rocket-scientist. Also, there will be star-wars like laser pew pew pictures & videos.\r\n\r\nIn the first part I will talk about the background of adaptive optics and how it enables ground-based observations which people though to be impossible only two decades ago. We will look at the building blocks of such a system and how they are combined to work together nicely.\r\n\r\nThe second part will look at a real Laser-AO system, the project I have worked with, ARGOS at the LARGE Binocular Telescope in Arizona. I will present the system in detail and talk about the little things in all the black boxes. Mechanics, electronics, Optics and Software. We will have images and videos of the system at work and look at first test results showing the potential of this system. \r\nARGOS feeds one of three near-infrared multi-object spectrometers that exists on this planet (Instruments name: LUCI). LUCI is used to record light from the universe 11 billion years ago to to answer the question where galaxies came from and how they developed. \r\n\r\nIn the last (somewhat shorter) part I want to briefly talk about what it takes to get into this kind of work, how to become a \u201elaser rocket scientist\u201c. I get this question a lot in Q&A sessions and therefore want to address it right away. There are misconceptions about his type of work and quite a number of people leave the field again \u2013 mainly because school and especially university puts up a distorted picture and sometimes questionable promises about careers in science.",

                                "description": "Soft robots are slowly trickling out of universities and labs into everyday life. Amazon is experimenting with installing soft grippers on robotic arms to pick any product off a warehouse shelf. DARPA just funded an extensive program to build soft exoskeletons for soldiers to enhance how much they can lift and how long they can march. My lab, Super-Releaser, is developing robotic spacesuit components for NASA as a subcontractor on a SBIR grant. On paper they might seem too complex to whip up at home, but if you\u2019re the kind of person who loved Creepy Crawlers and have access to a 3d printer you can make your very own soft robots.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s take a step back to explain what a soft robot is and what they're good for. Most robots out there are made from hard parts like steel gears and plastic housings with the occasional rubber wheel or timing belt thrown in. When they respond to their environment it\u2019s usually by reading sensors and using a processor to change their behavior accordingly. This responsiveness is called compliance. There\u2019s another way to get compliance out of an engineered object, though: make the object soft. Everything from goat hooves to octopus tentacles, starfish suckers to human muscles, use softness and springiness to their advantage. When your robot responds to the environment by bending, say around the thing you\u2019re trying to grip, getting a specific output, like putting that thing in a box to get packed up and shipped off, becomes a lot simpler on the computation side of things. Adding compliant mechanisms to your engineering toolbox can add huge problem solving power to any robotics problem you're trying to tackle.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I\u2019m going to describe how I go about fabricating soft robots. There are lots of methods out there \u2013 from heat sealing, to stitching, to direct printing \u2013 but the method I prefer is casting. I like casting my robots from 3d printed molds because I can test multiple designs in parallel (just print out the different molds with, say, different wall thicknesses or numbers of ribs inside the actuators, all at the same time). It also allows me to experiment with designs in a context that matches the material I\u2019d be using if production were scaled up for mass manufacture. Finally, if I decide I really like the robot I\u2019ve created, making a dozen of them is just a matter of casting that same mold a dozen times.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m going to go over the materials I use and where to find them online, how to go about designing your own soft robot, and some interesting problems in soft robotics that are just waiting for solutions. I\u2019m going to be taking the audience from building the simplest actuators, to methods for fastening parts, to getting airtight seals even at high pressures, to putting everything together into a single-piece walking quadruped.",

Clearly large American Internet companies are what the designers of the survey had in mind when they thought of platforms, but the definition of platforms proposed in the survey is much broader and could apply to anything from your personal website to not-for-profit collaborative projects like Wikipedia.\n\nQuestions range from rules for dealing with hate speech to copyright and liability, transparency and interoperability requirements for the operators of online platforms. That's why it's important that the Commission hears from as many users and developers of these platforms as possible, to ensure that they don't come up with any rules with drastic unintended consequences.",

We present Rowhammer.js, the first remote software-induced hardware-fault attack, from JavaScript. We also extend our presentation with an overview of cache side-channel attacks, that use the same technique to evict data from the cache.", 
                                "description": "Last year, studies demonstrated Rowhammer, a fault attack that can cause random bit flips by repeatedly accessing DRAM rows. This vulnerability has already been exploited to gain root privileges and to evade a sandbox, showing the severity of faulting single bits for security. However, these exploits are written in native code and use special instructions that flush data from the cache.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we present Rowhammer.js [1], a JavaScript-based implementation of the Rowhammer attack. After presenting the native attack, we underline the challenges we faced to trigger the vulnerability from JavaScript, without any special instruction. Beyond DRAM, this attack also requires a very fine understanding of CPU cache internals, that are largely undocumented. We detail our findings on these undocumented parts, and the different steps that led to the attack from JavaScript. We also give an outlook on possible exploits, including gaining root privileges from JavaScript and performing fault attacks on cryptography.\r\n\r\nIn the last part, we extend our presentation with an overview of cache attacks, bridging the gap between hardware-fault attacks and side channels. In side-channel attacks, the attacker doesn't rely on a direct software compromise, but rather on passive observation of hardware characteristics when a victim process runs. In common with Rowhammer.js, these attacks use techniques to evict data from the last-level cache.\r\n\r\n[1] Daniel Gruss, Cl\u00e9mentine Maurice, Stefan Mangard.

We\u2019ll then go\r\nback for a close reading of the Snowden documents that were published at 31C3 and show how such a cryptanalytic exploit lines up exactly with several of the NSA\u2019s most powerful known decryption capabilities.\r\n\r\nFor those who prefer a more hands-on approach, we\u2019ll tell you how you too can experiment with breaking Diffie-Hellman for the \u201eexport-grade\u201c 512-bit key sizes that were mandated in the 1990s by U.S. crypto regulations. About 8% of popular HTTPS sites still support these weakened keys for use with legacy browsers, but we discovered a TLS protocol flaw, which we named the Logjam attack, that allowed a man-in-the-middle to trick all modern browsers into accepting them.\r\nWe\u2019re pretty sure your browser has shipped a security update to fix\r\nthis by now...\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll conclude the talk by discussing what went wrong with\r\ncommunication between mathematical cryptographers and security\r\npractitioners, how we can prevent this from happening again, and what flavors of cryptography you should really be using to defend yourself.\r\n(Hint: It starts with \u201eelliptic\u201c and ends with \u201ecurve\u201c.)\r\n",

                                "description": "Die Hitag Transponderfamilie besteht aus mehreren unterschiedlichen Transpondern, zu denen auch der Hitag S geh\u00f6rt. Der Hitag S Transponder wird von dem Hersteller NXP in erster Linie f\u00fcr die folgenden Zwecke empfohlen: W\u00e4scherei-Automation, Logistik, Lagerverwaltung und die \u00dcberwachung und Verwaltung von Tierherden. In der Realit\u00e4t werden Sie aber auch in Zutrittskontrollsystemen wie dem blueSmart-System der Firma Winkhaus eingesetzt.\r\n\r\nDer Hitag S Transponder bietet zwei Modi: Plain und Authentication. Im Authentication Mode ist der Zugriff auf den Speicher des Transponders erst nach einer erfolgreichen Authentifizierung m\u00f6glich. Grundlage der Authentifizierung ist ein 48Bit Pre-Shared-Key. F\u00fcr dieses Verfahren ist laut Hersteller leserseitig ein Krypto-Coprozessor erforderlich.\r\n\r\nIn diesem Vortrag  erl\u00e4utern wir die unterschiedlichen, bei dem Hitag S, erfolgreich durchgef\u00fchrten Angriffe zur \u00dcberwindung der Authentifizierung bzw. dem Brechen des verwendeten Schl\u00fcssels. Hierbei ber\u00fccksichtigen wir sowohl deren chronologische Entwicklung als auch ihre steigende Komplexit\u00e4t. Neben einem einfachen Replay-Angriff, der uns bereits Zugang zu den auf dem Transponder gespeicherten Daten gibt, kann auch der verwendete Schl\u00fcssel gebrochen werden. W\u00e4hrend entsprechende Angriffe f\u00fcr den Hitag 2 bereits bekannt sind, gilt der Hitag S in der Literatur noch nicht als gebrochen. Wir haben die beschriebenen Angriffe auf den Hitag S \u00fcbertragen. Wir sind in der Lage den Schl\u00fcssel zu brechen und Informationen wie das Kennwort zu ermitteln, obwohl diese zus\u00e4tzlich vor Lesezugriff gesch\u00fctzt sind. In Abh\u00e4ngigkeit des gew\u00e4hlten Angriffs ben\u00f6tigen wir f\u00fcr das Brechen des Schl\u00fcssels zwischen mehreren hundert Tagen und 5 Minuten. Die hierf\u00fcr ben\u00f6tigten Daten k\u00f6nnen mit geeigneter Hardware innerhalb von wenigen Minuten durch Abh\u00f6ren der Funkkommunikation des Transponders mit einem Leser erhalten werden. \r\n\r\nWir haben einen Emulator gebaut, der jeden Hitag S Transponder nachbilden kann. Wird der Transponder in einem Schlie\u00dfsystem eingesetzt, k\u00f6nnen wir so eine Schl\u00fcsselkopie erstellen. \r\nBasierend auf unseren Ergebnissen und den Erfahrungen mit anderen Transpondern aus dem 125kHz Bereich k\u00f6nnen wir nur vor dem Einsatz in sicherheitskritischen Bereichen warnen. Hierbei ist es unerheblich, ob es sich um ein Online- oder Offline-System handelt. Keiner der uns bekannten 125 kHz Transponder verf\u00fcgt \u00fcber ausreichende Kryptographieverfahren, um derartige Angriffe abzuwehren. Daher ist, selbst bei starker Verschl\u00fcsselung der Daten auf dem Transponder, es immer m\u00f6glich mit einem Emulator einen exakten Klon zu erzeugen. Die Leseger\u00e4te, online wie offline, k\u00f6nnen diesen Klon nicht erkennen. Wenn die RFID-Anwendung die auf dem Transponder gespeicherten Daten nicht ausreichend sch\u00fctzt, k\u00f6nnen diese auch ver\u00e4ndert werden. Bei einer Schlie\u00dfanlage sind dann zum Beispiel beliebige \u00c4nderungen der Schlie\u00dfberechtigungen denkbar.\r\n",

It's wonderful what we do with a few slices of free spectrum without the need for any central coordination.\r\n\r\nThe Problem is: demand for these few radio resources is increasing faster than additional free spectrum gets allocated. A potential tragedy of the commons situation is approaching.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there is a heavy new user on the block: mobile operators want to start utilizing those free 5GHz bands. Protocols labelled License-Assisted-Access (LAA) or LTE-Unlicensed (LTE-U) have been put into silicon and large scale rollout can be expected to start during 2016.\r\n\r\nThis talk presents a modification to OpenWRT that will help coping with increased interference load over the next years. We think this feature is necessary to avoid a tragedy-of-the-commons situation in license-exempt bands (2.4/5GHz) due to ever increasing demands and node densities. The same way as we would be frustrated when we are unable to measure the general noise level in a room prior to deciding to use it to have a verbal conversation in it.\r\n\r\nWe started testing this feature (modifications to the mac80211 sublayer and to luci) at this years BattleMeshV8 in Maribor, Slovenia.

A new leak\r\n\r\nA new leak will be published during the talk: a secret document providing strong evidence that the government of Ecuador is not interested in free speech at all - or even freedom itself.\r\n\r\nSpeakers:\r\n\r\nBethany Horne grew up in Ecuador. She worked there for the state newspaper, El Tel\u00e9grafo, and later for the Free/Libre Open Knowledge Society, a research group operating out of a state university to develop policy for the Ecuadorian government. In 2013, she published a feature article in Newsweek magazine about Ecuador's oil drilling in the Amazon and human rights violations against local indigenous groups. As a result of this publication, she became a target of state surveillance. She now lives in Berlin.\r\n\r\nPedro Noel is co-editor at Associated Whistleblowing Press (AWP). Working on leaks since 2010, took part in more than 30 disclosures of leaked materials and performed analysis on leaked material denouncing wrongdoing and information of public interest in more than 15 countries. He is currently staff of Ecuador Transparente, a digital whistleblowing platform that in August 2015 published 31 pieces of secret information belonging to the Ecuadorian intelligence body.",

QKD allows two players Alice and Bob to securely communicate over an insecure line which is overheard by an eavesdropper Eve. Security can be proven in an information-theoretic sense against an unrestricted Eve. Such a high level of security is impossible to achieve with classical communication. In the first part of the talk, I will introduce some basic concepts of quantum information theory in order to understand and appreciate the security of QKD.\r\n\r\nHowever, quantum cryptography offers a wide range of <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.06120\">other applications</a> that go beyond the task of key distribution. For instance, the goal of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_cryptography#Position-based_quantum_cryptography\">\u201cposition-based cryptography\u201d</a> is to use a player\u2019s physical position as cryptographic credential. The combination of relativistic constraints (assuring that information cannot travel faster than the speed of light) and quantum mechanical effects (such as the impossibility to perfectly copy a quantum state) enables entirely new cryptographic applications like sending a message in such a way that it can only be read at a particular geographic position. In the second part, I will introduce you to this intriguing new branch of quantum cryptography.",

Therefore, it is not too surprising that it has security problems. However, it turns out that it has way too many problems. In this talk, we introduce how you can freely send data in the cellular network, and how an attacker can perform caller spoofing and denial of service attacks on calls to disable the target\u2019s calling. Furthermore, we explain how small implementation glitch on VoLTE may lead to break the whole cellular network down.", 
                                "description": "Voice-over-LTE (VoLTE) is a newly adopted voice technology in the LTE network, whose functionality is similar to VoIP. Even though VoLTE works similar to VoIP, implementing it on the cellular network is not an easy problem because it needs many changes at each component of LTE. If these changes are not securely considered, this may lead to several security problems.\r\n \r\nIn the legacy 3G network, as data and voice are separate, the accounting policies are also different: data is charged based on byte usage, and voice, on time usage. However, in VoLTE, even though voice is delivered as a packet, it is still charged by time usage. Therefore, this strange accounting policy might open free data channels.\r\n \r\nAnother point is that voice signaling for VoLTE is not handled as in the legacy 3G network. Basically, a phone has two processors: an application processor (AP) which runs mobile OSes such as Android and a communication processor (CP) which manages digital signal processing and radio access. In 3G, voice signaling is handled in CP which makes an attacker hard to manipulate it. However, in VoLTE, because voice signaling is handled in AP, an attacker can easily analyze or modify the call flow. Furthermore, this new change can cause problems to the mobile OS.\r\n\r\nTo scrutinize these two points, we analyzed 5 operators, two in the U.S and three in South Korea. As a result, we found four free data channels. For free data channels, an attacker can inject data in the call signaling procedure or voice data transmission. Additionally, the attacker can freely send data to the Internet or to another phone in the cellular network through the VoLTE interface. Furthermore, we discovered five security problems which include no encryption of voice packets, no authentication of call signaling, no call session management, IMS bypassing, and permission model mismatch in Android. We responsibly disclosed all the vulnerabilities to US/KR CERTs and Google in May. We suggest mitigations for each vulnerability, and further propose possible attack vectors that researchers can study on.",

Daniel Bleichenbacher had not yet started his assault on RSA and the types of side-channel attacks that enabled BEAST and POODLE had not yet been discovered. Over the next two decades, not only were weaknesses revealed in the protocol, but implementation flaws were found in even the most widely deployed SSL/TLS libraries. By following the security-relevant changes in SSL/TLS over the years we can paint a picture of the hard lessons learned by the cryptographic community over the history of this protocol all and how we can prevent ourselves from repeating the mistakes of the past.",

The 20th century philosopher Hannah Arendt is an important source to understand what `privacy' means and why we need to protect it. In my talk I am going to explain what Arendt understood as `private'  throughout her work, and how her reasons to claim the protection of the private realm were connected with her analysis of the totalitarian systems in the 20th Century. \r\nIn my contribution I am first discussing philosophical concepts of privacy, with a focus on Hannah Arendt's philosophy. Second, I am arguing why in a liberal-democratic system we need to protect our privacy. The third step will be to reason what we can morally do to prevent catastrophes such as a totalitarian system from happening again.\r\nBeing a philosopher, I am going to make the philosophical \u2014 and in part legal \u2014 claims and preconditions understandable for a larger public.  To prevent \"what never ought have happened\" from happening again we should, following Arendt, never refuse to judge about what is happening around us. I apply Arendt's framework of moral judging by examples to three cases from today's privacy discussions, Cybermobbing, Behavioral Advertising and secret services.",

                                "description": "We all know that writing large firewall rulesets can be hard. One huge problem. Let's write a tool to statically verify some properties of our rulesets! Now we have three huge problems:\r\n(1) writing flawless firewall rulesets.\r\n(2) making sure that our verification tool does the right thing.\r\n(3) making sure that the internal firewall model of our tool corresponds to the real world.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will solve these problems from front to back. We focus on problems (2) and (3). Warning: this talk involves math!\r\n\r\nFirst, we need to specify the behavior of the Linux netfilter/iptables firewall. In order to be convincing, this model must be small and simple. It should fit on one slide. However, firewalls can be quite complex and the model must cope with this. For example, looking at `man iptables-extensions`, we see numerous match conditions. But nobody required that our model must be executable code; we will specify the model mathematically. For example, this allows to define <i>arbitrary</i> match conditions. Technically speaking, we define the filtering behavior of iptables in terms of bigstep semantics. Mathematical specifications can be very powerful, in particular when we get to the point where the specification is not directly \"executable\".\r\n\r\nEnough math, let's write some executable code to do something with our ruleset. For example, unfolding the jumps to user-defined chains, checking that some packets will be certainly blocked, or checking that we got the spoofing protection right.\r\n\r\nSecond, based on our firewall model, we can now prove that our algorithms do the right thing. In contrast to testing, a mathematical proof allows assertions for all possible values. For example: For all possible packets, rulesets, and firewall-matching-features, our unfolding algorithm does not change the filtering behavior of the firewall. Yes, we can even show that our tool will still be correct, even if the netfilter team pushes a new matching feature.\r\n\r\nFinally, we now have a verified verification tool. We can use it to verify our firewall ruleset and finally sleep well at night again.\r\n\r\nWe developed an iptables verification library over the last few years in Isabelle/HOL. Isabelle can export executable definitions (i.e. our algorithms) to functional languages such as Haskell, Scala, SML, or OCcaml. Writing the input/output functions manually in Haskell, we have a fast and stand-alone tool.\r\n\r\nThis talk is also an introduction to interactive theorem proving and programming in Isabelle/HOL. We strongly suggest that audience members have some familiarity with functional programming. A strong mathematical background is not required.",

                                "description": "The terms \u201csocial innovation\u201d and \u201csocial innovators\u201d have become commonplace expressions in technology and development fields. More people have created new kinds of businesses and solutions to create positive impact in the society instead of just bringing interests to the partners of the company. However, in the last two decades, most resources available to build solutions for international development challenges were provided to institutions in richer countries. Most of the solutions, therefore, were coming from outside the local context or community. There are very few examples that show low-income people as responsible designers for good solutions. Several reasons try to explain why this has happened, but one essential reasoning is the belief that well educated people have more capacity to reach a good solution for any context, even if these people do not belong to the local culture or context. However, the main results of this methodology are anything but understanding and positive. The four main results are: dependence, lack of user needs understanding, (and, as such) little or no sense of ownership, and lack of maintenance.\r\nIn order to address these four problems, different approaches to social innovation have started to be tested. One model that tries to explain these different approaches are called Design For, Design With, Design By. If this model is studied deeper, it is possible to recognize that it translates the passage from the donator solutions mindset to the capacity-building solutions mindset. The two main parameters to define to understand the difference between those approaches is \u201cdesigner\u201d and \u201cuser.\u201d Design For expresses the fact the designer has very limited interaction with the user (typically only in the information gathering stage at the beginning and user testing at the end). This is typically what appropriate technology development looks like. Design With, also called co-creation and participatory development, brings together the user and the designer to understand the problem together, create solutions together and make decisions together in order to keep the project going forward. Design By defines the approach where the designer is also the user (and vice versa) or belongs to the same environment as the user. To test the Design By model, our Donor IDIN (www.idin.org) opted to support a local Innovation Center in a favela in Latin America, more specifically in S\u00e3o Paulo that the local organization Caos Focado has been responsible.",

They also don't allow you to run untrusted executables directly without compromising security, which is the reason why we require technology like virtual machines and containers to secure our systems.\r\n\r\nI am going to talk about a system I am developing called CloudABI. CloudABI is a simplified POSIX-like runtime environment that is inspired by FreeBSD's Capsicum. It allows you to create exectables that can solely interact with the environment through file descriptors (capabilities). This not only makes CloudABI more secure than the traditional POSIX runtime, it also makes it easier to test programs through dependency injection. This makes CloudABI a perfect environment for developing microservices.\r\n\r\nIn my presentation I am going to focus on how CloudABI works, how you can develop software for it and how it works in practice.",

In Germany, the lack of data disaggregated by race and ethnicity means that there are no figures on the extent of racially or ethnically based discrimination. Germany presents a unique case for examining the collection of disaggregated data due largely to the term race, or Rasse, having negative connotations due to the misuse of such data during the Nazi era.\r\n\r\nThis talk will focus on the potential ability of data disaggregated by race and ethnicity to reduce discriminatory policing in Germany, with a particular focus on \u2018stop and search.\u2019 Stop and search is a crime-prevention practice existing in both Germany and the UK which allows police officers to stop individuals they suspect of committing a crime, carrying a weapon, possessing stolen property, or carrying drugs. In Germany, federal police have the added power to stop a person suspected of committing an immigration violation.\r\n\r\nIn the UK \u2013 due to pressure from civil society organisations, academics, and government officials \u2013 data has been collected during police procedures, allowing for a monitoring and evaluation of discriminatory policing practices.

In Iran, a country that practises some of the most stringent censorship and surveillance techniques in the world has seen this transformation reshape the way the government implements information controls online. While applications with popular usage on browsers such as Facebook and Twitter remain blocked through their mobile applications, platforms that predominantly exist in app form such as WhatsApp, Viber, and Instagram remain unblocked in the country. This talk will look at how the government is counteracting these policies through various means, including local imitation apps, and new programs such as \u2018intelligent filtering\u2019, and the Revolutionary Guards' \u201cSpider\u201d program. Additionally, a discussion of how Iranian Internet users use these platforms, especially in reference to digital security awareness and practices will be included. ",

We shall get an intuitive understanding of the language through familiar concepts from imperative programming. We shall cover how Ling enables a modular and precise control on memory allocation, through  a general optimization called fusion. This optimization, fusion is a cost-free abstraction mechanism which brings high level programming to system programming.", 
                                "description": "The design of <a href=\"https://github.com/np/ling\">Ling</a> is the result of my researches in collaboration with Daniel Gustafsson and Nicolas Guenot at the IT-University of Copenhagen and also from the language <a href=\"https://lopezjuan.com/limestone/\">Limestone</a> by Jean-Philippe Bernardy and V\u00edctor L\u00f3pez Juan at the University of Chalmers.  These two lines of research stand upon the longstanding research topics of process calculi (such as the \u03c0-calculus), term calculi (such as \u03bb-calculus), Linear Logic, and dependent Type Theory (such as used in Coq and Agda to write proofs and programs).\r\n\r\nThe research on the \u03bb-calculus and Type Theory gave rise to a powerful family of languages including but not limited to: Haskell, OCaml, Coq, Idris, and Agda. The research on the \u03c0-calculus gave rise to a vast family of calculi for concurrency. However type systems for these languages took much longer to emerge and progress. For instance the main concurrent programming language in use today is still dynamically typed. This is changing as we understand better how to the use the formulae of Linear Logic as behavior types (or session types) for concurrent processes.\r\n\r\nStill the aim of this experimental language is to program systems precisely and modularly. The need for precision comes from the resource constraints such as memory, file handles and the need for modularity comes the desire to reduce programming mistakes by solving problems at the right abstraction level. Functional programming offers a pretty good framework for modularity. This modularity comes at a cost which is rather difficult to predict. One the one hand optimizing compilers can fuse function composition to eliminate the need for intermediate data-structures. One the other hand when such an optimization fails to trigger the resulting program might poorly perform. The system of Ling controls when fusion can happen. Therefore one knows statically when fusion occurs and when intermediate buffers are needed.\r\n\r\nToday concurrent systems are built out of shared memory. However, the shared memory model is a nightmare for programmers. Here the approach is reversed we start from a concurrent programming language and apply it also for shared memory. At first the goal is not necessarily to target a parallel architecture but to program at level of abstraction where the programmer knows precisely the resources needed and the compiler still has plenty of opportunity to re-order and parallelize safely some instructions.\r\n\r\nThis talk is intended at an audience familiar with imperative programming. Using the language should not require to understand anything about Linear Logic even though it is used fundamentally. Finally this presentation is an open call for comments and contributions to the open development of the language and infrastructure.\r\n",

Du darfst hier Fragen stellen, dich wundern, zweifeln und irritiert sein. \r\nWenn du an Quantenheilung, Vortex Atome und holistische Quanten-Kinesiologie glaubst, dann bist du herzlich willkommen um zu lernen, dass das mit Quantenphysik nichts, aber auch wirklich gar nichts zu tun hat, aber sei bitte nicht entt\u00e4uscht, wenn ich auf diese Themen nicht eingehe. Eine Stunde ist viel zu Kurz um zus\u00e4tzlich eine Einf\u00fchrung in die Prinzipien der Wissenschaft zu halten. \r\nWenn du aber schon mal die Schr\u00f6dingergleichung hergeleitet hast oder gerne \u00fcber die Vorteile der M-Theorie gegen\u00fcber der Super-Stringtheorie schwadronieren m\u00f6chtest oder wenn du diskutieren m\u00f6chtest, ob es vielleicht auch noch ein Typ 3 Weyl Fermion geben kann, dann langweilst du dich hier vermutlich, das k\u00f6nnen wir dann ja gerne ein anderes mal machen ;-)\r\n",

Additionally, protocols may be stacked on top of each other, tunneling IPv4 over IPv4 or IPv6 over IPv4, adding complexity to the replacement process. And finally, sanitizing TCP payloads is a certifiable nightmare because you never quite know what you're looking at, and the data segments may require reassembly/unpacking before you can do anything. It's easy to break sequence numbers, unless every replacement is exactly the same size as the original value. This talk will take a closer look at some of the typical problems that come up when sanitizing/anonymizing network packet captures, and at tools that can help with getting reasonable results.",

This year we have seen a lot of new hacks of knitting machines from Pfaff and Brother. While there is a lot of interest in using the software, it is difficult to engage with new developers as they often do not have access to machines. How can we improve the situation and welcome new contributors? How can we use the available program funding for students more efficiently?",

Not so many people seem to be concerned about the other side of the coin though, which is an ever-growing influence of algorithms on our personal life and the accompanying shift of decision power from humans to machines. In as little as 10 years, algorithms might decide if you get a new job \u2013 or if you get fired from your current one \u2013, how much you will pay for your health insurance, whether you will be allowed to travel to a given country and who you will marry. So it\u2019s time to say hi to your new boss: the algorithm.\r\n\r\nOften people talk either about the consequences of a data-driven society, or about the technological aspects of it, but rarely about the two together. With my talk I want to change that by discussing concrete technologies and algorithms that are used in data analysis today, together with their societal and political implications. I will show how algorithms can be trained to be racist, misogynic and plenty of other things, and that this actually happens in practice if no care is taken to avoid it. Finally, I will discuss various approaches to solve this dilemma, both technological and political.\r\n\r\nOutline:\r\n\r\n* Introduction to \u201ebig data\u201c and data analysis,\r\n* Parts of our lives that are already under algorithmic control,\r\n* Parts of our lives that soon will be under algorithmic control,\r\n* Example use case of algorithms in data science,\r\n* How machine learning can discriminate against certain groups of people,\r\n* Example algorithm: Classifying people in good and bad customers,\r\n* How the bias comes about: Algorithm-based discrimination,\r\n* How we can fix these problems.\r\n* Outlook.",

In addition the ruling could also be relevant case law for similar forms of \"mass surveillance\" by EU member states.\r\n\r\nIn addition to explaining the legal situation [and a couple of insiders], the following questions should be answered:\r\n- What are possible legal solutions for global services?\r\n- What are possible technical solutions for global services?\r\n- What are ways forward to enforce fundamental rights in the digital sphere?",

Most uses are rather pedestrian though, and even the more non-standard modifications to pure QR codes lack a certain technical finesse, opting to just overpaint part of the code and let error correction handle that instead. Let's see how we can do better.", 
                                "description": "The simple visual appearance of a QR code belies a very complex multi-step encoding process: Text is encoded using one or multiple character sets and encoding modes (allowing, for example, for a more efficient representation of strings of numbers), the resultant data is grouped into code words in segments with delimiters, error correction information is added, the augmented data is placed on the 2D matrix, structure obfuscation with a masking pattern is applied and version and format meta-data is added. each of these steps grants some degree of freedom to the encoder that will result in visually distinct but semantically identical codes.\r\n\r\nPrevious approaches to play with QR code appearance have usually stuck to modifying either end of this pipeline: Overwriting some parts of the finished code, or adding additional encoded data so that the finished code will have certain features embedded in it. The downside of these approaches is that you either rely on error correction to remove all the disturbances you've added, limiting the amount of modification possible, or become very limited in which pixels you can control.\r\n\r\nBy constructing an encoder and decoder that allows access to each step of the encoding/decoding process, I will allow you to go further and take control of the QR code as a whole. Changing all parameters of the encoding process will make the resulting code appear almost like you want it without relying on the error correcting capabilities, which then allows you to add further manipulations by abusing the error correction capabilities.\r\n\r\nAll code will be released under a free software license at the same time as the talk.",

But there are humans working day in and day out at secret service offices around the world, following orders, keeping secrets. How many of them feel ethically conflicted about their role in upholding these structures? How many of them might consider leaving and pursuing another career, if nudged in the right direction? Intelexit, an initiative produced by the Peng! Collective, reaches out to these people and offers them a friendly nudge and connects them with the right kinds of support if they wish to leave. Treading the line between art and activism, between spectacle and reality, Peng set up Intelexit to draw attention to the women and men working in the shadows, and to reach out to them. Intelexit was an experiment at first but it turned out to be very popular and needed, so it will continue into 2016 and it needs your help! ",

For example, it is possible to build \"NSA proof\" systems or to use legacy WiFi frames as radar.\r\n\r\nFirst, there will be a brief introduction on how to hack things with your rad1o badge and other cheap software defined radios. This is your chance to understand how radio waves look like and how to capture and process them :)\r\n\r\nSecond, the concept of wireless physical layer security is introduced. Based on this, information-theoretic secure systems for confidential communication and key exchange can be built.\r\n\r\nThird, wireless transmissions contain a lot of additional information, since they get disturbed depending on the environment. Hence, we can extract positions of humans and even loudspeaker movements through walls.",

Unfortunately the implementation was difficult to incorporate into normal system boot in a secure manner - anybody able to observe a user could recreate the secret. This presentation describes a method to allow systems to prove their identity to the user without making it trivial for attackers to mimic a secure boot and extract secrets from the user, and why the state of modern hardware means this may still not be enough.",

The Anti Evil Maid technique took advantage of this to encrypt a secret with the TPM in such a way that a system whose firmware or bootloader had been compromised would no longer be able to decrypt that secret. Unfortunately, the use of a static secret makes it easier for an attacker to mimic a good boot - as a result, a sufficiently motivated attacker could circumvent Anti Evil Maid and convince the user that a compromised system was in a good state.\r\n\r\nThis presentation describes the use of shared trust between the system and another device, making it significantly more difficult for an attacker to mimic a trusted boot. It includes a description of the implementation of Trusted Boot support in Free operating systems on modern UEFI systems, how this can be tied into sharing trust between multiple devices and the limitations that may still permit state-level actors to compromise these techniques.",

Their primary purpose is the discovery and exploitation of structure in an entropic environment, but they are capable to something much more sinister, too: they give rise to meaning.\r\nMinds are the solution to a control problem: in our case, this problem amounts to navigating a social primate through a complex open environment in an attempt to stave off entropy long enough to serve evolutionary imperatives. Minds are capable of second-order control: they create representational structures that serve as a model of their environment. And minds are capable or rationality: they can learn how to build models that are entirely independent of their subjective benefit for the individual. \r\nBecause we are the product of an evolutionary process, our minds are constrained by powerful safeguards against becoming fully rational in the way we construct these models: our motivational system can not only support our thinking and decision making to optimize individual rewards, but censor and distort our understanding to make us conform to social and evolutionary rewards. This opens a security hole for mind-viruses: statebuilding systems of beliefs that manage to copy themselves across populations and create causal preconditions to serve neither individuals nor societies, but primarily themselves.\r\nI will introduce a computational model of belief attractors that can help us to explain how our minds can become colonized and governed by irrational beliefs that co-evolve with social institutions.\r\nThis talk is part of a series of insights on how to use the epistemology of Artificial Intelligence to understand the nature of our minds.",

While PGP and S/MIME provide end-to-end encrypted mail, most users have yet to adopt these practices, and for users who have, these tools leave metadata, such as the subject, sender, and recipient, visible everywhere along a message\u2019s path. SMTP&mdash;the ubiquitous mail transport protocol&mdash;has evolved over the years to add encryption and authentication, both of which take place behind the scenes and help guard against surveillance and spam. While these features are being increasingly deployed, our research shows that they are almost always configured in vulnerable ways&mdash;the details of which are hidden from the users sending and receiving mail. Even more disturbingly, these vulnerabilities are being widely exploited in the wild: in seven countries, more than 20% of inbound Gmail messages are downgraded to cleartext by network-based attacks. In the most severe case, 96% of messages sent from Tunisia to Gmail are downgraded to cleartext. In this talk, I\u2019ll introduce the commonly used SMTP security extensions&mdash;including STARTTLS, SPF, DKIM, and DMARC&mdash;and describe the current state of mail security on the Internet. I'll describe several commonly occurring attacks our recent research has found and discuss how mail operators can configure their servers to secure email transport. Finally, I'll discuss several weaknesses in the protocols we're using and recent proposals for helping secure email transport.", 
                                "description": "<p>Email carries some of our most sensitive communication, including private correspondence, financial details, and password recovery confirmations. We expect that messages are private and, in many cases, unforgeable. However, SMTP&mdash;the protocol responsible for relaying messages between mail servers&mdash;did not originally authenticate senders or encrypt mail in transit. Instead, servers support these features through SMTP extensions. Adopting these features is entirely voluntary and they have only been gradually adopted. As a consequence, mail servers still tolerate unprotected communication and will send messages in clear text if any problems occur when negotiating a secure connection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier this year, I worked with colleagues at the University of Michigan and Google to measure the global adoption of email security features and try to better understand how well email is secured in practice.  Our study draws from two unique data sources: connection logs for Gmail spanning 16 months, plus a snapshot of SMTP server configurations from April 2015 for the Alexa Top Million domains. From Gmail\u2019s perspective, incoming messages protected by TLS have increased 82% over the last year, peaking at 60% of all inbound mail. However, this improvement was largely because a small number of popular web mail providers deployed TLS&mdash;many organizations still haven't deployed these features correctly. I will discuss these results and many more that reveal several major weaknesses in the global deployment of mail transport security.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This security patchwork enables network attackers to intercept and surveil email. In one kind of attack, actors corrupt the TLS handshakes at the the start of an SMTP connection to downgrade the connection to cleartext&mdash;exposing messages to potential eavesdropping. Using Internet-wide scanning, we identified more than 41,000 SMTP servers in 193 countries that are routinely forced to deliver email as cleartext.  We analyzed the mail sent to Gmail from these hosts and find that in seven countries, more than 20% of all messages are prevented from being encrypted by active network attacks. In the most severe case, 96% of messages sent from Tunisia to Gmail are downgraded to cleartext, but even in Denmark, nearly 4% of messages are affected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a second class of attack, DNS servers provide fraudulent MX records for popular email providers. We searched for servers that provide fraudulent addresses for Gmail\u2019s SMTP servers, and we find 14.6K publicly accessible DNS servers in 69 countries provide falsified responses. We investigate the messages that Gmail received from these hosts and find that in 193 countries more than 0.01% of messages from each country are transited through these impostor hosts. Six of the eight most-affected countries are in Europe.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>In this talk, I will first introduce the security extensions for SMTP and the current state of mail security. Then, drawing on our measurements, I will discuss the weaknesses in these protocols and the attacks we see occurring in the wild. I'll discuss what  mail server operators, developers, and even end users, can do to protect against these problems. Finally, I will present current proposals for securing mail transport and several weaknesses that we still need to address.</p>",

                                "description": "Randomness is as simple as critical. An application wants some bytes which an attacker can't predict. The clearest example is generating a cryptographic key, but a wide array of functions depend on randomness.\r\n\r\nAny time a key is generated, any time a DSA signature is made, any time the memory layout is randomized, applications rely on being able to create strings of bytes impossible to predict. If that comes short everything fails: cryptographic keys are compromised, exploits protections are ineffective.\r\n\r\nEntropy, the unpredictable raw material, is usually collected by the Operating System and exposed to the applications that need it. Once enough bits of entropy have been collected, it becomes impossible to predict the output of the CSPRNG (cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator), a stirrer of sorts that expands a seed into unlimited whitened random bytes, often based on stream ciphers or hashes.\r\n\r\nReal risks include trying to use a CSPRNG early on in the boot process, when not enough random events have been collected, or using a userspace CSPRNG instead of the kernel one and forgetting to seed it. Or using a non-CS PRNG.\r\n\r\nThat's just about it. However, there is a lot of misunderstanding on \"decreasing entropy\". It's a widespread myth that using random bytes decreases the \"amount\" of entropy. Reality is, to an attacker who's basically trying to predict the CSPRNG output there's no decrease in difficulty no matter how much output is drawn, so developers can avoid introducing additional complexity because of this.\r\n\r\nThis is all backed up by showing a simple toy CSPRNG design, and reasoning about its properties.\r\n\r\nMore practically, the points above translate into \"in Linux, just use /dev/urandom or the get_random syscall\". That's the kernel interface for the system CSPRNG. Its inner working are presented and they will hopefully make it clear why there is no meaningful difference from the \"counting\" /dev/random.",

Bereits in der Begutachtungsphase wurde das Gesetz massiv kritisiert. Der AKVorrat gab mit einer umfassenden Stellungnahme die wichtigsten Argumente vor. Der Widerstand gegen das Gesetz und die Kampagne des AKVorrat haben zwar zu mehrfacher Verschiebung der Beschlussfassung gef\u00fchrt, aber die Geheimdienstpl\u00e4ne der Regierung sind trotz mehr als 22.000 Unterzeichnerinnen und Unterzeichnern der Petition auf www.staatsschutz.at nach wie vor nicht vom Tisch.

Der aktuelle Gesetzesvorschlag stattet Polizeibeh\u00f6rden mit Geheimdienstbefugnissen aus, die einer unabh\u00e4ngigen Kontrolle weitestgehend entzogen sind. In unserer Analyse stellen wir unsere Kritikpunkte in einen gr\u00f6\u00dferen Kontext, der der Idee einer \u00dcberwachungsgesamtrechnung folgt.\r\n\r\nWir stellen unsere Kampagne vor, die auf zwei S\u00e4ulen steht: Aktivismus und politisches Lobbying. Der Spagat zwischen beiden Polen ist nicht immer einfach, aber unbedingt n\u00f6tig, um die Breite des Widerstandes gegen das Gesetz darzustellen. Der reicht von der Bischofskonferenz, \u00fcber Amnesty International bis zu Arbeitnehmervertretungen. Die juristische Expertise des AKVorrat macht uns auch zu ernstzunehmenden Gespr\u00e4chspartnern von Politikerinnen und Politikern.\r\n\r\nThomas Lohninger und Werner Reiter vom AKVorrat \u00d6sterreich zeichnen das Bild eines ereignisreichen Widerstands gegen die Einrichtung eines Inlandsgeheimdienstes inkl. Gehimdienstdosenschie\u00dfen und dem Defacement der Kampagnenwebsite.

                                "abstract": "    Embedded systems are omnipresent in our everyday life and are becoming \r\n    increasingly present in many computing and networked environments. For example,\r\n    they are at the core of various Common-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) devices such as\r\n    printers, video surveillance systems, home routers and virtually anything we \r\n    informally call electronics. The emerging phenomenon of the Internet-of-Things\r\n    (IoT) will make them even more widespread and interconnected. Cisco famously\r\n    predicted that there will be 50 billion connected embedded devices by 2020.\r\n    Given those estimations, the heterogeneity of technology and application fields,\r\n    and the current threat landscape, the security of all those devices becomes of\r\n    paramount importance. In addition to this, manual security analysis does not\r\n    scale. Therefore, novel, scalable and automated approaches are needed.\r\n    In this talk, we present several methods that make *the large scale\r\n    security analyses of embedded devices* a feasible task. We implemented \r\n    those techniques in a scalable framework that we tested on real world data. \r\n    First, we collected a large number of firmware images from Internet \r\n    repositories and then performed simple static analysis. \r\n    Second, since embedded devices often expose web interfaces for \r\n    remote administration, therefore we developed techniques for large scale \r\n    static and dynamic analysis of such interfaces. \r\n    Finally, identifying and classifying the firmware files, as well as \r\n    fingerprinting and identifying embedded devices is difficult, especially \r\n    at large scale. \r\n    Using these techniques, we were able to discover a large number of new \r\n    vulnerabilities in dozens of firmware packages, affecting a great variety of vendors and\r\n    device classes. We were also able to achieve high accuracy in fingerprinting and\r\n    classification of both firmware images and live devices.",

                                "description": "Modern vehicles have several advanced driver assistant systems (ADASs). This is the beginning of the full automation of the driving task. Vehicle manufacturers already showed first fully automated prototypes but a lot of challenges have to be addressed until such systems will be commercially available. One challenge is to provide the necessary information for the self-driving vehicle to make the right driving decisions. V2V communication is one possible technology to provide this information. The proposed talk is an introduction to the state of the art of V2V communication based on IEEE 802.11p.\r\n\r\nThis talk is a technical introduction to Vehicle2Vehicle communication. It will introduce the basic concepts of V2V technology and provides references to documents of the standardization. The talk will consist of the following parts:\r\n\r\nMotivation:\r\nThe talk starts by describing the scope and possible applications of V2V communication focusing on the use-case of the \u201cElectronic Emergency Break Light\u201d. What is more, V2V communication will be compared to traditional on-board sensors like Lidar or Radar.\r\n\r\nBasic concepts:\r\nThe state of the art concepts of V2V communication based on IEEE 802.11p and its differences compared to consumer WiFi will be discussed in this section. Furthermore, the existing concepts and standards developed in both Europe and the U.S. will be compared, with a special focus on the differences between the two approaches. In summary, the following questions will be addressed:\r\n\u2022\tWhat are the approaches for V2V communication in Europe and the U.S.?  \r\n\u2022\tHow is communication realized for V2V?\r\n\u2022\tWhich standardization approaches exist and where can they be found?\r\n\u2022\tWhat are the most important disseminated information and messages?\r\n\u2022\tHow are these messages formatted? (header structure)\r\n\u2022\tWhat are the differences between the V2V communication concepts in the U.S and Europe ?\r\n\u2022\tWhich technical challenges have to be solved?\r\n\r\nPrivacy and Security:\r\nAs V2V communication will be used to broadcast the vehicle\u2019s position and dynamic state, the privacy of the driver has to be protected. The talk will introduce the pursued concepts for privacy protection, whilst ensuring that only authorized entities are able participate in the communication. Due to the complexity of the topic, this section will focus on the concepts and the standards found in Europe.\r\n\r\nPerspective:\r\nEventually, the talk will address future work within the field of V2V communication, such as novel ADASs and privacy concepts.\r\n\r\nRemarks: The talk is only about the state of the art of V2V technology, its standardization and its further development.\r\n",

This is of immediate concern to open source software developers who would like to remain anonymous. On the other hand, being able to de-anonymize programmers can help in forensic investigations, or in resolving plagiarism claims or copyright disputes. \r\n\r\nI will report on our new research findings in the past year. We were able to increase the scale and accuracy of our methods dramatically and can now handle 1,600 programmers, reaching 94% de-anonymization accuracy. In ongoing research, we are tackling the much harder problem of de-anonymizing programmers from binaries of compiled code. This can help identify the author of a suspicious executable file and can potentially aid malware forensics. We demonstrate the efficacy of our techniques using a dataset collected from GitHub.", 
                                "description": "It is possible to identify individuals by de-anonymizing different types of large datasets. Once individuals are de-anonymized, different types of personal details can be detected from data that belong to them. Furthermore, their identities across different platforms can be linked. This is possible through utilizing machine learning methods that represent human data with a numeric vector that consists of features. Then a classifier is used to learn the patterns of each individual, to classify a previously unseen feature vector.\r\n \r\nTor users, social networks, underground cyber forums, the Netflix dataset have been de-anonymized in the past five years. Advances in machine learning and the improvements in computational power, such as cloud computing services, make these large scale de-anonymization tasks possible in a feasible amount of time. As data aggregators are collecting vast amounts of data from all possible digital media channels and as computing power is becoming cheaper, de-anonymization threatens privacy on a daily basis.\r\n \r\nLast year, we showed how we can de-anonymize programmers from their source code. This is an immediate concern for programmers who would like to remain anonymous. (Remember Saeed Malekpour, who was sentenced to death after the Iranian government identified him as the web programmer of a porn site.) We scaled our method to 1,600 programmers after last year\u2019s talk on identifying source code authors via stylometry. We reach 94% accuracy in correctly identifying the 1,600 authors of 14,400 source code samples. These results are a breakthrough in accuracy and magnitude when compared to related work.\r\n \r\nThis year we have been focusing on de-anonymizing programmers from their binaries of compiled code. Identifying stylistic fingerprints in binaries is much more difficult in comparison to source code. Source code goes through compilation to generate binaries and some stylistic fingerprints get lost in translation while some others survive. We reach 65% accuracy, again a breakthrough, in de-anonymizing binaries of 100 authors.\r\n \r\nDe-anonymization is a threat to privacy but it has many security enhancing applications. Identifying authors of source code helps aid in resolving plagiarism issues, forensic investigations, and copyright-copyleft disputes. Identifying authors of binaries can help identify the author of a suspicious executable file or even be extended to malware classification. We show how source code and binary authorship attribution works on a real world datasets collected from GitHub.\r\n\r\nI hope this talk raises awareness on the dangers of de-anonymization while showing how it can be helpful in resolving conflicts in some other areas. Binary de-anonymization could potentially enhance security by identifying malicious actors such as malware writers or software thieves.\r\n \r\nI would like to conclude by mentioning two future directions. Can binary de-anonymization be used for malware family classification and be incorporated to virus detectors? Obfuscators are not the counter measure to de-anonymizing programmers. We can identify the authors of obfuscated code with high accuracy. There is an immediate need for a code anonymization framework, especially for all the open source software developers who would like to remain anonymous.",

                                "description": "Surveillance was on the street before it was online, and that hasn\u2019t changed. What has changed is that cities around the world are now bristling with street level surveillance technology, like GPS tracking devices, IMSI catchers, biometrics, drones, and cameras of all kinds. Much like the business of selling malware to repressive regimes, big multi-national corporations like General Electric and Morpho have made huge profits off the spread of this technology, and have helped it spread like wildfire.  \r\n\r\nEven in places like the United States, where, in the last 20 years, crime rates have steadily and significantly declined, the use of this incredibly invasive technology is excused by \u201cpublic safety\" or \"crime prevention needs.\u201d Justifications range from warnings about terrorism (often thinly-veiled jabs at activists like the Black Lives Matter movement or anti-austerity activists in Greece) to conflating \u201cnational security\u201d with disaster preparedness. Similarly, In Latin American, government authorities  have used surveillance measures to discredit and stigmatize social movements involved in protests.  \r\n\r\nStreet level surveillance is also often part of preparation for major events. The technology left behind becomes integrated in to everyday policing. The 2012 Olympics in London was accompanied by a host of new technology, including iris scanners, biometric ID cards, automated license plate readers, and facial-recognition CCTV systems. In preparation for the 2014 World Cup Games, Brazil spent millions on CCTV, drones, facial recognition goggles, surveillance helicopters, and a mobile high-frequency radio wave scanner, as well as 14 digital command centers across the country (featuring huge ceiling-to-wall monitors to facilitate real-time monitoring of surveillance cameras.) The country also integrated their national and international databases with cooperating parties, like Interpol, and subjected Brazilians to this invasive data collection technique.  Intelligence agents mapped protest routes and monitored demonstrators by tracking their social media accounts. The 2016 Brazil Olympics are sure to make use of this technology\u2014and provide an excuse for more.  \r\n\r\nThis talk will cover what kind of street level technology we\u2019re seeing, how it\u2019s spreading, and who\u2019s making money off of it. We\u2019ll also talk about some of the security flaws hackers have exposed on these technologies, and put out a call to action to CCC. \r\n\r\nSpeakers are:\r\nNadia Kayyali, Activist at Electronic Frontier Foundation. They focus on street level surveillance technology such as IMSI catchers and drones, US national security policy, privacy, anonymity, and freedom of expression. Nadia has worked on EFF\u2019s Street Level Surveillance and Surveillance Self-Defense projects, advocated for anonymity and privacy with governmental bodies and companies like Facebook, and has coordinated a variety of US campaigns to limit surveillance at the national and local level. As a Syrian-American, Nadia got especially interested in surveillance because of the experiences of Arab and Muslim Americans after 9/11. \r\n\r\nJoana Varon, Founder and Director of\u00a0Coding rights and consultant and independent researcher on Internet Governance and Digital Rights. Previously, Joana was a researcher and project coordinator at the Centre for Technology and Society from Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Getulio Vargas in Rio de Janeiro. While there, she worked on applied research on information and communication technology for development. Joana is a lawyer and holds a bachelor\u2019s degree in international relations and a master\u2019s degree in law and development. She is concerned about how the lack of true Internet freedom impacts human rights, innovation and, ultimately, development",

Researchers particularly in the fields of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Computer-Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) but also in the social sciences generally have begun to study hacking empirically\u2014investigating hacking as a practice and as cultural phenomenon.\r\n\r\nHowever, Fefe, an influential blogger of the German hacking community, warned against collaborating with researchers: \r\n\r\n \u201eIn letzter Zeit gibt es eine auff\u00e4llige H\u00e4ufung von Befragungen und wissenschaftlichen Studien zu Hackern und Piraten, wie die Szene funktioniert und so weiter, auch bei Hackerspaces und insbesondere auch bei Gruppen wie Occupy und co. Wenn so jemand bei euch anklopft, sagt ihm bitte nichts. Nur weil die freundlich und nett wirken, muss man noch nicht kooperieren.\r\nNanu, hat der Fefe was gegen Wissenschaft? Nein. Aber was die meisten nicht auf dem Radar haben: Solche \"Studien\" werden von den B\u00f6sen gemacht. Dahinter stecken Public Relations Consulting-Firmen, Risk-Management-Firmen, Politikberatung, Thinktanks. Die haben Angst vor uns und wollen uns ausforschen. Und wie macht man das? Man schickt unverd\u00e4chtige V-Leute. In diesem Fall nerdige Wissenschaftler, die freundlich anfragen.\u201d (7.2.2013, blog.fefe.de/?ts=afed4222)\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will not be able to speak about undercover spying for corporate or government interest (because I don\u2019t know any more about it than Fefe). Instead, this talk will be about the research that some of those \u2018nerdy scientists\u2019 that Fefe mentions do\u2014researchers like my collaborator and me who thought: Hacking! Yes! That\u2019s an interesting phenomenon, and it is important! For many social scientists, hacking is interesting because it challenges their academic thinking and their academic vision. It challenges the categories in which some research fields usually think (e.g., \u2018the user\u2019 as opposed to \u2018the designer\u2019). And it also can challenge how disciplines such as HCI (who perceive themselves as advocates for prospective users) envision themselves. \r\n \r\nThe talk offers a glimpse of the spectrum of research about hacking in HCI, CSCW, and adjacent fields. Researchers in these fields portray hacking very differently. The spectrum ranges from \u201ctransgressive craft\u201d to \u201cinnovative leisure practice,\u201d from skilled craftsmanship to ad hoc kludging, from an individualist pursuit to a community mission, from an expression of liberalism to an exclusive practice of cultural distinction. Some researchers see hacking as an illustration of how to defy technological determinism, i.e., the conviction that the technological determines the social, a position that social scientists typically fight ferociously. Other researchers see it as the future of \u201cend-user innovation.\u201d\r\n\r\nClearly, there is often vested academic interests in the ways in which social scientists portray hacking. In some cases, there is an interest in emphasizing the economic value of hacking, highlighting its creative and innovative potential. In other cases, there is an interest in emphasizing the pedagogical value of hacking, highlighting its potential as a means of teaching and learning. In still other cases, there is a conceptual interest in hacking or an interest in its cultural value. And yes, in some cases there is clearly an interest in simply preventing hacking. \r\n\r\nMy personal motivation to study hacking has a lot to do with my conceptual interest in notions such as \u2018use\u2019 and \u2018design.\u2019 Is hacking using, is it designing, is it both? And I find it interesting to note that hacking practices often react to a condition where the possibilities of \u2018use\u2019 are perceived as very limited. But my personal motivation to study and write about hacking in the HCI/CSCW community also stems from discontentment with the way in which HCI/CSCW research often sidelines the political visions of hacking\u2014most notably, the vision of \u2018open,\u2019 community-driven technology that is an \u2018expression of liberalism\u2019 (Gabriela Coleman).\r\n\r\nMy motivation to give this talk is to communicate research back to those who are the subjects of research. The research discourse is, besides the mass media discourse, an important place for creating a public image of \u2018the hacker.\u2019 Moreover, I would like to discuss Fefe\u2019s warning\u2014\u201cdo not talk with researchers,\u201d is that what 32C3 thinks? And what, after all, is hacking?\r\n",

The projects described in the talk can be found in the link section but will have to be fleshed out in more detail until the CCC event. In short: it will be a \"tour de force\" through various human rights/technology projects to give the audience a wide perspective with which they can (hopefully!) find ways for future collaboration. The talk will also touch briefly on challenges and risks using technology in mass atrocity prevention - because we all know: technology has no morality and can be used for both good and evil.",

With every 3d printer running the need for plastics and therefore the amount of waste produced (either through failed prints or normal end of life of the print) will grow. Even if there are things you won't need to buy anymore and the additional waste is compensated here, the reality shows that failed prints can't be ignored, 3d printers are used to print a lot of nonsense things (e.g. internet memes) and the lifetime of these prints is often below commercial grade products.\r\n\r\nIn this talk i'll present the difficulties in recycling plastic as well as the progresses or fails i've made. \r\n\r\nHow easy is it to recycle 3d prints or other wast in order print it again? \r\nHow often can this process be repeated? Does it save money? \r\nDo the new prints look good? \r\n\r\nAs a special feature i'll try to collect some waste from the audience at the beginning of the talk and recycle it live on stage!\r\n\r\nAbout me: i'm 25 years old and use 3d printers since several years and run 9 3d printers at this time. With so many printers, the amount of waste gets at a point where it feels like i would waste a lot of money and increase the negative environmental impact if i don't recycle the fails and unused prints. I brought several printers to events like 30-31C3, GPN13-14-15 or the CCCamp15 (you may remeber me as obelix, the guy with the tent full of 3d printers).",

In this talk we\u2019ll harness the might of the English dictionary, cut corners to achieve sane running times for insane computations, and use fancy Machine Learning\u00ae methods \u2013 all in order to build a classifier with a higher standard for gibberish plausibility.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, there has been a rising trend in malware\u2019s use of Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) as a fallback mechanism in case the campaign is shut down at the DNS level. DGAs are a headache to deal with, but they have one big drawback \u2013 they make a lot of noise. To be more precise, they generate a very large amount of DNS requests for domains, and the domains are often complete gibberish.\r\n\r\nThis situation looks ripe to be exploited with your favorite Cyber\u2122 Machine Learning\u00ae Big Data\u00a9 solution; and indeed, advances were made by basic language processing methods that could detect and stop the outright complete gibberish. These worked well, until DGAs mutated, and started producing more reasonable gibberish. A milestone in this regard was the introduction of KWYJIBO, a DGA that generates gibberish where every other letter is a vowel (e.\u00a0g. \u201egarolimoja\u201c), which stumps the old methods completely.\r\n\r\nHow do you thwart KWYJIBO and other DGAs of its sophistication? How do you look for meaninglessness in string-space? In this talk we\u2019ll harness the might of the English dictionary; cheat mathematics to cut running times from impossible to reasonable; and demonstrate a fancy Cyber\u2122 Machine Learning\u00ae Big Data\u00a9 tool based on all the above to tell apart meaningful domain names from nonsense.

We will discuss why media coverage has been biased and investigate public knowledge of, as well as public reactions to, surveillance. We will show that people are concerned about surveillance but feel disempowered to resist it, and explore why many social/political/environmental activists have been reluctant to change their communication practices after Snowden. And we will suggest a \u201adata justice\u2018 framework to form part of broader social and economic justice agenda in order to resonate with a broader public.\r\n\r\nThe project \u201eDigital Citizenship and Surveillance Society\u201c is hosted at Cardiff University and includes researchers from Cardiff, the Oxford Internet Institute and the Technical University of Delft. It investigates the responses to the Snowden revelations for policy, technology, civil society and the news media. In this talk, two of the investigators will present findings from research that included content analysis of the British press and broadcast news, interviews with journalists and activists, and focus groups with a wide range of the British public. They will uncover widespread worries about surveillance amongst both activists and wider population but, at the same time, a lack of knowledge and confidence to address it socially, politically and technologically. \r\n\r\nThe research provides insights for digital rights campaigners, crypto developers, and everyone interested in the Snowden leaks.

Influencing advertisement revenue and cost, elections, or feigning consumer interest.\r\nThese profiles are not representative of actual human entities, and are only created to pass for people through Facebook\u2019s detection algorithms. Somewhat similar to how a social registration number creates a physical legal identity.\r\nWith generated names and interests, with downloaded images, these accounts have verified email addresses, and the most valuable profiles are Phone Verified Accounts, so called PVAs.\r\nPVAs generated with United States based phone numbers are most valuable since they are checked less by Facebook, than profiles verified with Pakistani, Bangladeshi or Filipino for example.\r\nThe last countries playing a big part in the artificial virtual identity industry. \r\nAlthough this industry has been active for many years, commodifying our idea\u2019s of what shapes an online identity, many journalists, political parties, institutions, and consumers still believe that the quantified attention of a number of likes or friends on Facebook suggests a validation of quality.\r\nBy collecting a large collection of custom made PVA\u2019s into an army, Dullaart is commenting on the use of these false validation systems.\r\nWhere PVA\u2019s are normally used for commercial gain, Dullaart will use them for performative and artistic gestures only. \r\nAn argument in a political conversation is suddenly liked by thousands of people, and an aspiring artist suddenly has a lot of people speaking of her work.\r\n\r\nThe newly created profiles that shape the army will be based on the identities of the 18-th century Hessian auxiliaries contracted for military service  to the British during the American revolutionary war. Using all the actual names of the mercenaries, and acting in the spirit of the army as studied by Professor Doctor Holger Gr\u00e4f, of the Hessian Historical Landes Ambt.\r\nThe yearly income generated by renting out the Hessian Mercenaries equaled 7 times the tax revenue of the state Hessen-Kassel, and gave Frederick II the opportunity to build many public works, amongst which the Fredericianum in Kassel, and many public roads.\r\nAfter the presentation of the army on the 10th of November in Kunsthalle Schirn in Frankfurt, the army will be for rent to pay for the maintenance (the profiles need rented internet proxies to keep from being killed off by Facebook) , and act under the command of Constant Dullaart and an editorial board discussing which valuable contributions the army can deliver in the political, cultural, or poetic realm on Facebook. \r\n\r\nDullaart wil show the experiences in creating and controlling the army for artistic purposes, as well as previous research into new types of digital materials for artists to use.",

CS knowledge comes in handy when scraping government websites, searching giant troves of documents and analysing social graphs. Recently popularised techniques like machine learning and other techniques can be used to explore and uncover hidden truths in datasets. New research areas such as algorithmic accountability (e.\u00a0g. how can you find the cheating algorithm in the VW cars) become more important and lead to stories that require a journalistic mind to discover them but need reverse engineering skills to fully understand.\r\n\r\nI will give a roundup of how stories are told with the help of computers in newsrooms around the world. As a software engineer by trade working in an investigative newsroom I\u2019m also applying the stuff I learn to help my reporter colleagues find and tell new kinds of stories.",

                                "description": "On 17th December 2014, the Government of India's Ministry of Communications and Information Technology issued an order to all licensed Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in the country to block access to 32 websites, effective immediately. Not only did the ban affect access to popular cultural sites such as archive.org, vimeo.com, dailymotion.com, but the order also blocked access to sites like github.com, pastebin.com, which are useful for all sorts of people but are especially popular with software developers.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry's order was issued following a request from the Mumbai police's Anti-Terrorism Squad on 15th November 2014. The police request argued that the targeted web services were being used for \"Jihadi Propaganda\" by \"Anti-National groups\", and were encouraging youth in the country to join organisations like the Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL).\r\n\r\nAs a response to this, a few technologists in Berlin got together and thought it would be a good idea to do some research using free and accessible tools to look at how censorship has been implemented, as well as the various techniques that could be used to circumvent this censorship.  The research was conducted through January, 2015 and draws on the browsing experience of several customers of different ISPs around India as well as information gained through the use of the open source censorship measurement toolkit provided by Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI) [1] and other manual tests we conducted. Since then, we have been able to turn this into a continued effort to monitor ISPs in India and invited others to contribute to this effort to map and understand various technical implementations of censorship orders.\r\n\r\nThis talk will summarise our key findings, including the different methods of blocking implemented by multiple ISPs.\r\n\r\nWe will also discuss and make recommendations about the different ways ISPs can better handle such censorship orders, while continuing to respect the their customers' right to access to information, and how they can be more transparent while exercising censorship orders and requests from authorities.\r\n\r\n[1] http://ooni.torproject.org/",

No wonder: users have gotten used to \u201cfree\u201d services and it\u2019s no easy feat for companies to get people to pay or support what they use. But of course \u201cfree\u201d is a far cry from *freedom*.\n\nIf payments were instant, practically free, and managed automatically (e.g. by web browsers), online services could sustain themselves without tracking us or pleading us to click to donate. An open payment method for the web that could it possible for providers to charge tiny amounts to customers visiting websites. It could, at least in theory, change the way the Internet works -- but for the better or worse? Paid open source software could become a viable business. It could be the end of advertising and tracking. Or would it usher in a new age of paywalled content that would shut out those unable to pay? Would it provide an additional tool for surveillance or juicier targets for thieves?\n\nThis workshop will include a short explanation and demonstration of the new Interledger Protocol (ILP) for payments across payment networks. ILP is an open payment protocol being developed in a W3C Community Group to enable secure transactions between bank accounts, Bitcoin wallets, community currencies, and more. We will discuss the pitfalls that have sunk many previous micropayment schemes and we will explore and debate the implications of actually bringing frictionless payments to the Internet.",

They often portray hackers and hacktivists negatively and put them onto the same level with, for example, terrorists. This talk is based on a PhD research project examining the perception of self-identified hackers and hacktivists on these (in)securitising developments. It investigates how hackers and hacktivists understand themselves and their activities, explores how they articulate the effects of this (in)securitisation, and outlines the ways they resist these processes. ", 
                                "description": "Within the public discourse, terms such as hacking and hacktivism are controversial. They are frequently equated with malicious activities and associated with the likes of cybercrime or cyberwarfare. Besides, both the activities and the actors standing behind these concepts are increasingly becoming subject to a threat construction. This process is understood as \u201c(in)securitisation\u201d which builds upon the idea that security issues do not necessarily reflect the objective, material circumstances of the world. Instead, what is considered as a \u201csecurity threat\u201d depends on the design of such a menace by a multitude of actors, e.g., politics, industry, or the media. \r\n\r\nThe talk uses this understanding to examine the perspective of hackers and hacktivists who have been subjected to this (in)securitisation. It is based on a sub-study which is part of a broader PhD project within the social sciences. It exhibits qualitative findings that are derived from interview data collected over the course of a Research Fellowship at the Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society, Berlin. A sample of N = 35 (female: n = 6; male: n = 29) self-identified hackers and hacktivists were therefore interviewed in German or English. The data was analysed using the method of thematic analysis. \r\n\r\nThis talk explains the theoretical background of the research project, the method used to analyse the data, and presents as well as discusses some of the research\u2019s findings. It concentrates on the following issues: (a) how participants understand themselves and their activities, (b) how they articulate the effects of the (in)securitisation process, and (c) how they resist the (in)securitisation. Ultimately, the presentation gives an overview of what the (in)securitisation \u201cdoes\u201d to the hacker and hacktivist community, who - for the purpose of this research - have been studied conjunctively. It highlights how hackers\u2019 and hacktivists\u2019 self-understanding and perception stand in contrast to their current public representation, providing a relevant insight for the current debates about the possibility of re-articulating political rights online.",

The proposals are often made in the name of protecting national security, but are likely to have severe economic, political and social consequences for these nations and their citizens, while doing little to protect their security. Contrary to these government proposals, encryption has a critical role to play in national security by protecting citizens against malicious threats. The harm to the public that can be presented by lax digital security has been illustrated too many times: weak or flawed cryptography led to vulnerabilities such as Logjam and FREAK that compromised the transport layer security protocols used to secure network connections worldwide.

Could this data serve as a method by which governments predict whether or not the individual will commit a crime? This talk will examine the use of big data in the context of predictive policing. Specifically, how does the data collected inform suspicion about a particular individual? In the context of U.S. law, can big data alone establish reasonable suspicion or should it just factor into the totality of the circumstances? How do we mitigate the biases that might exist in large data sets?", 
                                "description": "This talk will examine the current big data programs utilized by governments and police departments around the world and discuss how they factor into individualized suspicion of persons. Can big data sets with the proper algorithm effectively predict who will commit a crime? What are the appropriate margins of error (if any at all)? I will discuss the use of algorithms on big data sets to predict both where crime will occur and who might commit it.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I will discuss the types of data that exists in these databases and compare several different ways in which computer algorithms are used on big data sets to predict something about a particular individual. Should predictive policing algorithms more closely resemble those used to predict disease from DNA samples or those used in the clearance process? Should they be used at all? ",

                                "description": "Physical keys and locks are one of the oldest security mechanisms still employed\r\ntoday. Despite their long-standing history, many still suffer from known\r\nattacks including bumping, impressioning, teleduplication, and rights \r\namplification. To mitigate these attacks, many lock systems rely on restricted\r\nkeyways and use blanks that are not sold to the general public, making it harder\r\nfor attackers to obtain them. Often the key blank designs themselves are\r\npatented, further discouraging distribution or manufacture by even skilled\r\nmachinists.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will investigate how rapid prototyping and 3D printing tools\r\ncan be used to attack modern lock systems. Even when manufactured on commodity\r\nmachines, 3D printed keys are now good enough to be used in a variety of\r\nattacks. We demonstrate this by showing several example attacks against popular locks, from 3D printing the TSA master key, to our own attacks against restricted key systems. To test the strength of modern 3D printed keys, we present results from our paper of a controlled analysis on a range of printed\r\nmaterials from plastic to metal, and show that it is possible to cheaply make or purchase 3D printed keys that are practically as strong as real keys. We also present a tool that can automatically\r\ncreate a CAD model of a key blank, given only a single picture of the front of \r\nthe corresponding lock. This tool makes the attacks that 3D printing enables\r\nagainst locks even easier and cheaper by no longer requiring skilled 3D design knowledge, and provides a warning to start looking\r\nfor alternatives to secure physical goods. Lastly, we describe defenses\r\nthat modern lock manufacturers can do to ensure their locks are not easily\r\nbypassed by 3D printing technology, including new lock designs, as well as putting more emphasis on existing designs that may resist 3D printing-enabled attacks for years to come.\r\n\r\nWebsite: https://keysforge.com/\r\nPaper: https://keysforge.com/paper.html",

                                "description": "There\u2019s a lot of emotion involved with social media with posts, images, and songs; all of those events have a context and that\u2019s a context algorithms can\u2019t understand. However, humans can. A Social Media Break Up Coordinator goes through a clients social media accounts with the client, and helps block, unfriend, untag, and help \u201amute\u2018 old relationships and bad memories. \r\n\r\n\u201eSocial Media Break Up Coordinator\u201c will be presented as lecture over my performance which is debuting at Babycastles on Nov 21st, and 22nd. I am a user researcher and UX designer at IBM Watson. I work in conversational analytics and I help design systems and software layout for chat bots. I spend a lot of time thinking about the way systems and AIs \u201athink\u2018 about and relate to words, context of conversations, and emotions. The way our social media systems are structured, there\u2019s a fair amount of outlining and \u201awork\u2018 users have to do when it comes to reporting online harassment, changing privacy settings, etc. But in that same vein, there's a lot the systems do for us- from suggesting users, suggesting content, to display of content, messaging, images, and events. All of those \u201athings\u2018 are coming from content created by users, and are treated as data. But what is the context of it all? Facebook can see if a user removes a relationship status, but there isn\u2019t a button or an algorithm for break ups. How do you a tell a system your child died or your heart was broken?\r\nThat\u2019s where the Social Media Break Up Coordinator comes in. I will perform a series of paid events for my customers, who will also sign a legally binding. These services range from untagging the user and the ex or chosen person in specific images, moving friends of the ex/person and the ex/person onto a special list (to either mute, see less content, etc), crafting a series of emotional neutral messages to alert the other person that they are being unfriended/unfollowed/blocked for specific reasons, taking the number of the ex, deleting it from the client\u2019s cellphone, and holding onto it for a specified amount of time decided upon between the client and myself. \r\nEffectively, the way to emotional navigate really \u201asticky\u2018 situations in social media is to have human intervention. Human emotions and relationships are complex and complicated, and require context, very deep context to understand. This is just something an algorithm cannot do. I\u2019m interested in exploring emotional labor and the creation of new digital services and job to aid in this area of human relationships that have gone awry or death, as more and more users lives are lived and shared online, especially when algorithms began to fail with this kind of content.\r\n\r\nThe talk/lecture at CCC would feature documentation of my performance, research that I\u2019ve done around blocking, muting, and a wide variety of social interactions (from abusive arguments with Gamergaters to navigating spaces with exes- ex boyfriends, girlfriends, best friends, and co-workers). I will also lecture on the structure of Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram- and how the UI first fails with users when it comes to \u201ade-couple\u2018 or \u201aun-friend\u2018. I\u2019ll then lecture how the algorithms fail, because all of the interactions of these are designed towards users interacting, not users completely separating from other users who may be very connected by friends and professional networks. What is the solution for this? My hypothesis is a series of newly created human roles, almost like a freelance life couch, to help the user get their digital lives in \u201aorder\u2018. ",

In Sierra Leone, the health system was only weeks away from total collapse due to an inability to manage or pay health workers across the country and the world braced for the unchecked spread of the disease throughout west Africa. In the face of apocalyptic scenario, a company made up of local hackers took on the unprecedented challenge of building, implementing and running a huge Management Information System and Mobile payments system to keep the health system from collapsing. This talk will show how this was achieved with Open Source Software, second hand laptops, hacked voter registration machines, second hand smartphones and some very smart and determined young people used to achieving great things with none of the resources we take for granted. We salute them.\r\n",

This unprecedented capacity gives Facebook power to shape discourse approaching the degree of religious institutions and the state \u2013 two of the traditional institutions that we have long relied on for shaping our society-wide morality and values. \r\n\r\nBy compelling users to comply with the arbitrary content standards laid out in their ToS, Facebook is essentially laying out a new global standard for what people can and can not see. This standard, however, is not derived from the same moralistic traditions of previous moral paradigms, but is a calculated business decision crafted in the boardrooms of Silicon Valley. Risk averse, Facebook has created a global content standard that is in place not to contextualize the world for their users, but to meet perceived expectations of acceptable speech in a diverse range of nations.\r\n\r\nOur project, OnlineCensorship.org, seeks to capture instances of censorship across social media platforms.

                                "abstract": "In the last couple of years, cloud and web services have become more and more popular. Since Snowden we know for sure that intelligence agencies have access to the data storage of an  service provider, either by (forced) cooperation, or espionage. Thus, to protect our privacy we have to encrypted our data before hand it over to our service provider (data holder). But this approach contradicts the very idea of a web service where the data holder have to process our data in one way or an other. Therefore, we need new cryptographic techniques to enable the  data holder to perform operation on encrypted data. One of the most important operations for cloud storage or database based web/cloud  services is the search operation.  In this talk we focus on the very familiar cloud storage scenario. Because in this scenario, It is obvious, that the user (data owner) do not want to perform the search by himself. This should be a service offered by the data holder. We will present different practical approaches to achieve searchable ciphertext, namely one with an index and one with cleverly encrypted words.\r\n\r\nNote that no PhD is required to attend this talk ;-)", 
                                "description": "We found that many people cannot believe that it is possible to execute operations on ciphertext.  We want to rectify this by educating hackers of the magic of searchable encryption schemes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Intro</h4>\r\n\r\n\"The Cloud\" has undoubtedly become very popular over the last decade.   Many people like the convenience of virtually unlimited storage and computing power at their fingertips.    However, people tend to dislike to disclose their data to third parties.   A simple solution would be encrypt the data before uploading it to a third party, but you may very well want to perform certain operations on the encrypted data such as a search.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Entering Searchable Encryption</h4>\r\n\r\nThis conflict of encryption and the ability to execute computations on data seems to be inherent.   However, clever encryption schemes which allow certain search operations on ciphertext exist!   We  will present some searchable symmetric encryption schemes which enable others to search for keywords or substrings without learning  they key nor the plaintext.  You may very well ask what the security implications in those cases are, so we will present the associated security notions.    Another concern is performance reg. speed or memory consumption.   We present our measurements of prototypical implementations and infer that searchable symmetric encryption schemes can indeed be practical.\r\n\r\nOur vision is to store data remotely in an encrypted fashion without losing convenience of using third party applications.\r\nWe want to enable developers to secure their databases and we want to make users aware of advances in cryptography so that they demand more secure services.   Given the properties, other use cases of secure keyword search include email or document storage.   In fact, it is possible to not only secure relational databases, but to create secure big data scenarios where massive amounts of data are being handled.",

Welche Auswirkungen hat das auf die Netzstabilit\u00e4t? Wann kommen die Stromnetze an ihre Leistungsgrenze? Wie kann ein gezielter Angriff auf das Europ\u00e4ische Verbundnetz aussehen?

Dieses Kriterium setzt jedoch voraus, dass Betriebsmittel immer unabh\u00e4ngig voneinander ausfallen. Durch den Stromhandel, aber auch durch die vermehrte Einbindung regelbarer Lasten gibt es in Zukunft externe Ereignisse, welche die Ausfallwahrscheinlichkeiten mehrerer Betriebsmittel gleichzeitig beeinflussen. Dies kann vermehrt sowohl zu gro\u00dffl\u00e4chigen (d.\u00a0h. Bundesland aufw\u00e4rts) als auch zu kleineren Ausf\u00e4llen f\u00fchren.\r\n\r\nDie Netzfrequenzmessdaten der Schnellabschaltung des Kernkraftwerks Gundremmingen liefert die Grundlage f\u00fcr ein Modell, mit dem das notwendige Lastungleichgewicht zur Destabilisierung des Verbundstromnetzes abgesch\u00e4tzt werden kann. Der Vortrag diskutiert verschiedene Szenarien, wie eine solche Lastschwankung verursacht werden k\u00f6nnten: durch gezielte Smart-Meter-Manipulation? Durch Fehler in Stromleitungen oder Umspannwerken? Durch den Angriff von Gro\u00dfkraftwerken? Oder durch Marktmanipulationen an der Stromb\u00f6rse?\r\n\r\nAuch im kleinen Ma\u00dfstab kann nat\u00fcrlich die Stromversorgung ausfallen: zum Beispiel bei einem kleinen Stadtnetzbetreiber. Eine Statistik der Bundesnetzagentur \u00fcber Netzausf\u00e4lle in Deutschland wird ausgewertet, um z.\u00a0B. den Einflu\u00df der Energiewende auf die Zuverl\u00e4ssigkeit der Stromversorgung zu bewerten. Der Realit\u00e4tsgehalt der offiziellen Daten muss jedoch angezweifelt werden.\r\n\r\nSchlie\u00dflich versucht der Vortrag, Wege aufzuzeigen, um die Resilienz des Stromnetzes zu erh\u00f6hen. Weniger technische Hindernisse als vielmehr das Festhalten der Energiewirtschaft an ihren Gesch\u00e4ftsmodellen verhindert eine Umstrukturierung der Stromversorgung, die \u2013 neben der einfacheren Integration der erneuerbaren Energien \u2013 auch die Stabilit\u00e4t des Gesamtsystems erh\u00f6hen w\u00fcrde.",

Mesh network communities like Freifunk are building decentralized network infrastructure, which is also used to provide internet access to refugees in Germany. There are countless other examples of useful and innovative projects that are enabled by having free software wireless drivers.\r\n\r\nHowever, the sad reality is that the hardware choices for these kinds of innovative projects are very limited, not because of limitations in the actual hardware, but because of the lack of datasheets, information, reference source code, developer time, etc.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will show how we got the state of Linux wireless support to the point where it is now, and I will rant viciously about what's holding us back. \r\n\r\nI have been working on wireless drivers for a few years now, and as a contractor for chipset manufacturers, I was given a glimpse into the maze of insanities that is holding back progress significantly.\r\n\r\nBut no matter how much bureaucracy, lame excuses, NDA crap and other weird things vendors (and now also the FCC) throw at us, there is still hope for a better future...",

Proprietary de facto standards of the dominant companies have lead to the emergence of virtual \u201cinformation silos\u201d that can barely communicate with one another. Has Diaspora really lost the war? Or is there still a chance to succeed?", 
                                "description": "The Internet today is a giant web, a hilarious copy machine, interlaced into more and more aspects of our lives. What started as a network of equal nodes, has since transformed the layer above the open, decentralized hypertext protocol, and begun to move it towards greater centralization and power in the hands of few large platforms. Social networks are an important benchmark for this trend. \r\n\r\nSocial networks are an important tool for private, commercial and political use. Technological sovereignty can be decisive for political struggles, regardless of whether we talk about elections or revolutions. Privacy gains importance when the Internet becomes interconnected with more and more parts of our lives. The launch of Diaspora in 2010, a crowdfunded free-to-use social network based on free software, was clearly born from these debates. While the appeal of a federated system of social contacts is same in centralized and decentralized networks, they are worlds apart regarding their technical infrastructure, their power structures and their options for business models. \r\n\r\nMuch scientific work has been carried out on the technical challenges that decentralized social networks face. But the underlying economic mechanisms that drive the market towards concentration, promote the dominance of few actors and build high barriers for market entry, have so far been rarely addressed in the context of social networks. The dominance of one network is deeply rooted in the code of the market structure troubled with network effects, lock-in and proprietary de facto standards. Furthermore, privacy restraints through the operator derive from the very core of the business model of multi-sided markets as a bottleneck between users and advertisers. Lock-in and switching costs, make it difficult for users to leave their social network, thereby weakening competition. Such a structure enforces asymmetric power relations between users and providers systematically.  \r\n\r\nHere\u2019s the thesis: Whoever wants to challenge the incumbent\u2019s position needs to address these findings since this structure poses high barriers for market entry. Centralization of infrastructure on the market for social networks can not be reversed with technology alone. Decentralized social networks need foremost to consider how to breathe life into their provided infrastructure, since it is the user content and the interconnection between users that adds value and meaning to a social network. Projects that want to reintroduce technological sovereignty need good technology combined with a straightforward strategy for market entry. Some of these strategies differ substantially from standard strategies, since non-commercialized decentralized community driven projects based on the idea of free/ libre open source software differ in many aspects from companies. The fact that Diaspora built an alliance with other decentralized social networks of the Federation based on shared open standards is an important development and can be regarded as a good move towards joining forces against a paramount incumbent. It will be shown that although decentralized social networks face tough conditions entering the market for social networks, there are promising strategies that have not yet been exhausted. \r\n\r\nThe controversies which arose around the centralization in the market for social networks are now more pressing than ever. This talk shall present an overview of the impact of social networks and the driving economic forces of this market. The status quo of the Diaspora network and the Federation as the most prominent representative of free and open source non-commercial decentralized alternatives will be analyzed. Next, the economic analysis of the relevant market structures will be used to derive fresh perspectives on how this \u201cnew kid on the block\u201d could develop a strategy for a successful market entry. The findings are supported by expert interviews with authorities in relevant fields and data from Diaspora and connected networks.",

My own personal independent research of the Chinese internet and the popular Chinese social app, WeChat \u5fae\u4fe1, has contributed to an ongoing massive archive I began in 2014 called The Chinternet Archive. To date, I have over 15,000 pieces of content (and growing) documenting localized trends, memes, vernacular photography, online personas, .gif animations, videos, selfies, propaganda, retail, family/work life, and other such digital artifacts of online Chinese culture. This archive directly influenced my artistic and curatorial practice, resulting in an online art collection called Netize.net, or its Chinese name of \u7f51\u53cb\u7f51 [w\u01cengy\u01d2uw\u01ceng] \u201cInternet Friend Network\u201d, which collaborates with emerging Chinese and international artists who are exploring or deconstructing East/West dichotomies, engaging in Sino-centric Web aesthetics, or investigating the East online. The goal of this talk is to explore through my Chinternet Archive and Netize.net collections, forms of creativity found in China in relationship to it\u2019s early internet history, interactions with technology, localized networks and restrictions.", 
                                "description": "Michelle Lee Proksell \u5a9a\u6f47 (b. 1985, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia) was born a Third Culture Kid (TCK) to ex-patriate American parents and experienced extreme forms of censorship and governmental monitoring in Saudi Arabia during her formative years. This influenced and shaped her interest and direction in exploring transcultural experiences online in relationship to localized access and dissemination of information, via forms of censorship or self-censorship. Her childhood exploring Asia and years working in new media and internet-related galleries and projects led to her eventual fascination with the unique history of the Chinese Internet. Since 2012 she has been working with creatives in China who engage in technology and the internet, resulting in two major projects documenting online digital artifacts and the emergence of Net Art in China:  The Chinternet Archive and Netize.net \u7f51\u53cb\u7f51 \u201cThe Internet Friend Network\u201d.\r\n\r\nIn this lecture, Michelle will briefly introduce Chinese digital media and online culture through her first hand experience and research. She will touch upon the topics of what it\u2019s really like to deal with the Great Fire Wall on a daily basis, the influence of WeChat on contemporary Chinese digital culture, creative trends from her Chinternet Archive, and memes pertaining to recent viral media events. She will also introduce artists and their artworks from her Netize.net \u7f51\u53cb\u7f51 project. She will reflect on how people are engaging creatively with the changes of the Chinese internet, how this influences artists and what we can learn from localized networks and the increasingly blurred lines between real life and virtual life.\r\n",

Doch es ist auch m\u00f6glich, einen Forth-Compiler direkt im Microcontroller zu installieren, mit dem \u00fcber ein Terminal kommuniziert werden kann und welcher es erlaubt, \"von innen heraus\" auf die Hardware zuzugreifen sowie jede neu geschriebene Routine sofort von Hand auszuprobieren. Forth ist ein alter Hut - wer jetzt jedoch an langsam denkt, mag \u00fcberrascht sein: Ein optimierender Forth-Compiler mit Konstantenfaltung und Registerallokator passt mit 20 kb Gr\u00f6\u00dfe sogar in den LPC1114FN28 ! Wie die Optimierungen \"an Bord\" funktionieren, soll in diesem Vortrag erl\u00e4utert werden. Assemblerkenntnisse f\u00fcr MSP430 und ARM Cortex M sind von Vorteil. Wer Forth genauer kennenlernen m\u00f6chte, kann gern auch zur Assembly der Forth-Gesellschaft kommen.",
